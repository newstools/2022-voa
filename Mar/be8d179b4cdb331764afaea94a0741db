The U.S. government has announced sanctions on 21 entities and 13 individuals involved in the Russian technology sector that it says are evading already existing sanctions to prevent the country from accessing western technology for military purposes. The U.S. Treasury said on Thursday the sanctions are "part of its crackdown on the Kremlin's sanctions evasion networks and technology companies, which are instrumental to the Russian Federation's war machine." “Russia not only continues to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine with its unprovoked aggression but also has escalated its attacks striking civilians and population centers,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen in a statement. “We will continue to target Putin’s war machine with sanctions from every angle, until this senseless war of choice is over.” On March 24 the United States sanctioned dozens of Russian companies in the defense-industrial base for supporting the invasion of Ukraine.
