Some associations of soldiers’ mothers in Russia had raised concerns about a number of conscripts going incommunicado at the start of what the Kremlin calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine, suggesting they could have been sent to fight despite a lack of adequate training. The Kremlin and military authorities had denied it until now. 12:05 p.m.: U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said Russia's proposals to create humanitarian corridors from Ukraine to Russia are "absurd" as he called for Russia to allow civilians in Ukraine to leave safely.

The Kyiv-Classic Symphony Orchestra also performed an excerpt from Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy”, on which the European Union’s anthem is based - a nod to the Ukraine government’s desire to move closer to Europe and away from Russia’s orbit.

Conductor Herman Makarenko told reporters that the concert was a call for peace. He said he managed to gather around 20 musicians for the performance, instead of 65-70 who normally make up the ensemble.
