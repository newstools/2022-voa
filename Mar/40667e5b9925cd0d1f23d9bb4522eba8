Some of Ukraine’s most vulnerable citizens have reached safety through an effort of solidarity and compassion that transcended borders and raised a powerful counterpoint to war.

A train pulled into the station in Zahony, Hungary on Wednesday carrying about 200 people with severe physical and mental disabilities – residents of two orphanages for the disabled in Ukraine’s capital Kyiv that were evacuated as Russian forces battered the city.

“Territorially, the orphanages are where the rockets flew, where there were bursts of rifle fire. A metro station near the orphanage was blown up,” said Larissa Leonidovna, the director of the Syyatoshinksy orphanage for boys in Kyiv. “We spent more than an hour underground during the bombing,” she told AP.

The disabled refugees, most of them children, disembarked the train into the cold wind of the platform and into the arms of dozens of Poles and Hungarians waiting to receive them. From there, they were escorted to four waiting buses, sent from Poland by the Catholic relief organization Caritas. 10:22 a.m.: VOA’s Eastern Europe Chief Myroslava Gongadze tweets that residents of the Ukrainian city Kherson, site of recent heavy fighting, are reporting a lack of food and fuel.

High Commissioner for Refugees, who released a statement Thursday. “I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one. Hour by hour, minute by minute, more people are fleeing the terrifying reality of violence. Countless have been displaced inside the country,” he said. “And unless there is an immediate end to the conflict, millions more are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine,” he added. 8:48 a.m.: In a video address to the nation early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to keep up their resistance but he didn’t comment on whether the Russians have seized any cities, according to The Associated Press.“They will have no peace here,” Zelenskyy said, calling on the Russian soldiers to “go home” and describing them as “confused children who have been used.” 8:32 a.m.: A press officer for Russia’s Defense Ministry, Major General Igor Konashenkov, has claimed that the Russian military is only hitting Ukrainian military targets in its invasion of that country – repeating his claim about precision weapons as recently as Wednesday, March 2.

Ahead of the meeting, Sergey Lavrov told reporters in Moscow that Russia will press its military action in Ukraine until achieving its goals, chiefly the “demilitarization of Ukraine” but added that it will be up to Ukrainians to choose what government they should have. Talks are expected to be held in the Brest region of Belarus, which borders Poland, AP said.
