The Chinese city of Shenzhen is in lockdown, following an uptick in COVID-19 cases. Shenzhen, often described as China’s Silicon Valley, is home to several Apple suppliers, including Foxconn.

The city’s public transportation has closed, and residents are being tested. Meanwhile, former U.S. president Barack Obama has tested positive for COVID, but his wife Michelle has not. Both are vaccinated. "Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted," Obama posted on Facebook. "It's a good reminder that, even as cases go down, you should get vaccinated and boosted if you haven't already to help prevent more serious symptoms and giving COVID to others." India announced Monday that it is opening its COVID vaccination campaign to 12-to-14-year-olds. Previously, vaccination was limited to those 15 years old and older.

India’s Health Ministry also announced Monday that everyone over 60 is eligible for the COVID vaccine. Previously, people were with a potential co-morbidity condition were not eligible to receive the shot.

“It's really miraculous that we were able to see the scientific advancements we needed to have vaccines for this illness generated in less than a year after the pandemic was declared,” Mihir Mankad, Doctors Without Borders-USA's senior advisor for global health advocacy and policy, said in a recent statement. “But what we have failed at doing, and we continue to fail at doing, is to ensure that these tools are equitably available across the world.”

Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centers reports there have been more than 6 million global deaths related to the coronavirus.
