Twitter says it has created a version of its microblogging service that can be used by Russians despite the regular version of the service being restricted in the country. The service will be available via a special “onion” URL on the darkweb that is accessible only when using a Tor browser. Onion URLs and Tor have long been used by those seeking to work around censorship as well as those who are involved in illegal activities on the darkweb. The announcement of the new site was made by a software engineer who does work for Twitter. “This is possibly the most important and long-awaited tweet that I've ever composed. “On behalf of @Twitter, I am delighted to announce their new @TorProject onion service,” wrote Alec Muffett.
