No media source currently available 2:00 a.m.: A new report by the International Monetary Fund forecasts a major contraction in the Ukrainian economy as a result of the Russian invasion. The report said the economy is expected to shrink by 10% in 2022, but that could become worse depending on the length of the conflict. The IMF is expected to approve $1.4 billion in emergency funding for the country. The IMF applauded Ukraine’s efforts to keep its financial system functioning and to fulfill its obligations despite the crisis. “Making wage and pension payments, restocking ATMs with cash, opening bank branches ... continuing to make payments on external debt obligations, so that post-war they can resume normal operations with their creditors and markets. It’s really actually a remarkable, remarkable effort,” Ivanna Vladkova Hollar, the IMF mission chief for Ukraine said, according to Reuters.  1:15 a.m.: Negotiators from Russia and Ukraine are due to hold more talks Tuesday as Russia presses its nearly three-week invasion with bombardments of Kyiv and other major Ukrainian cities. A round of negotiations Monday, held by video rather than in-person in neighboring Belarus like previous sessions, yielded still no major signs of a breakthrough. Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted after Monday’s talks, “Communication is being held yet it's hard.” He had raised hope of progress on Sunday by saying Russia had been “listening carefully to our proposals” and was beginning to talk “constructively.” The parties actively express their specified positions.

They’re lying to you here.” Studio producers rushed to cut her off, VOA’s Jamie Dettmer reports. This is the second time Russian One has had a problem controlling the message. Last week, on the popular talk show hosted by Vladimir Soloviyev, two pundits broke ranks and likened the war raging in Ukraine to Russia’s quagmire in Afghanistan in the 1990s. During the broadcast filmmaker Karen Shakhnazarov said Russia’s invasion risked isolating the country. He called for the war to stop, and warned: “If this picture starts to transform into an absolute humanitarian disaster, even our close Allie’s like China and India will be forced to distance themselves from us.” Later during the broadcast guest Semyon Bagdasarov, an academic, said: “Do we need to get into another Afghanistan, but even worse?” No media source currently available 12:00 a.m.: Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered his “heartfelt condolences” to the family of U.S. filmmaker and journalist Brent Renaud who was killed on Sunday by Russian forces while documenting refugees fleeing the conflict.
