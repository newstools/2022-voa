The United States intends to provide Ukraine with an additional $100 million in civilian security assistance, the State Department said Saturday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the assistance would be to build the capacity of the Ukrainian ministry of internal affairs with a view to aid "border security, sustain civil law enforcement functions, and safeguard critical governmental infrastructure."
