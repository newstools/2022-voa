North Korea said it conducted "another important" test for reconnaissance satellite systems, state news agency KCNA reported Sunday, a day after regional military authorities reported the launch of a ballistic missile from the country for the second time in a week. The launch drew condemnation from governments in the United States, South Korea and Japan, which fear the North is preparing to conduct a major weapons test in the coming months. They see the North's satellite launches as thinly veiled tests of ballistic missile technology banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions. North Korea's National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA) and the Academy of Defence Science conducted the launch "under the plan of developing a reconnaissance satellite," KCNA reported. It was the second such launch in a week to test satellite equipment, and the ninth missile launch this year. "Through the test, the NADA confirmed the reliability of data transmission and [the] reception system of the satellite, its control command system and various ground-based control systems," KCNA said. Like the last test on Feb. 27, KCNA did not elaborate on the type of rocket used in the launch.
