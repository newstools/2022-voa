At least five people were killed in a shooting attack Tuesday in the Israeli city of Bnei Brak, a suburb of Tel Aviv. It is the third deadly attack in recent days. Two days ago, two police officers were shot dead in Hadera; the week before, four were stabbed to death in Beersheba. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for both attacks. The most recent attack took place in two places, police said, and was carried out by a gunman on a motorcycle. Israeli media reported the gunman shot toward apartment balconies in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood and then turned to firing at pedestrians, Reuters reported. The gunman was then shot and killed. Islamic State attacks in Israel are rare, according to The Associated Press. Just hours before Tuesday’s shooting, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called the recent attacks a "new situation" and urged greater security measures. The attacks come just before Saturday's expected start of Ramadan and as foreign ministers from four Arab states, the U.S. and Israel meet in the Israeli desert to discuss issues in the region. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.
