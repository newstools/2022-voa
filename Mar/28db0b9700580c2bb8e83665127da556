Ottawa announced Thursday it was establishing a new immigration program that would offer Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion a temporary Canadian residence permit for up to three years. Canada, which has a large Ukrainian diaspora, especially in the center and west of the country, said in a statement that "Ukrainians and their immediate family members of any nationality may stay in Canada as temporary residents for up to three years." Applicants are required to apply online and provide fingerprints and a photo. Ukrainian refugees can simultaneously apply for a work and study permit. Ukrainians and their families already settled on Canadian soil will also benefit from the new measures and can "extend their visitor status or work permit for 3 years, apply for a new work or study permit, or extend their existing permit." According to a United Nations count released Thursday, more than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the deadly Russian invasion on Feb. 24. More than half have taken refuge in Poland.
