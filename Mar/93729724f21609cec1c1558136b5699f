The United States on Wednesday announced sanctions on five Iranians and several Iranian entities it said were involved in the country’s ballistic missile program. The sanctions specifically target the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Research and Self Sufficiency Jihad Organization, which is responsible for the research and development of ballistic missiles, the Treasury Department said. Also targeted was Iran’s Parchin Chemical Industries. “We have taken this action following Iran’s recent missile attack on Irbil, Iraq, as well as missile attacks by Iranian proxies against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. “These attacks are a reminder that Iran’s development and proliferation of ballistic missiles pose a serious threat to regional and international security.” Brian Nelson, undersecretary of the treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the move was aimed at preventing Iran from developing advanced missiles. “While the United States continues to seek Iran’s return to full compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action [which restricted Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief], we will not hesitate to target those who support Iran’s ballistic missile program. We will also work with other partners in the region to hold Iran accountable for its actions, including gross violations of the sovereignty of its neighbors,” he said in a statement.
