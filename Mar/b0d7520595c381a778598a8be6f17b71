For the latest developments of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, all times EDT: 6:25 a.m.: The United Nations on Wednesday named three human rights experts to conduct an investigation into possible war crimes and other violations committed during the conflict in Ukraine, Reuters reported. The independent panel has a mandate to “investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law and related crimes in the context of the aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation,” a statement said. The U.N. Human Rights Council agreed on March 4 to establish the commission of inquiry, for one year, at the request of Ukraine and allies including the European Union, Britain and United States. 5:10 a.m.: A spokesman for the World Food Program said the agency welcomes talk of a possible pullback of Russian forces in parts of Ukraine but the process of negotiating aid access has not improved. Tomson Phiri told The Associated Press on Wednesday that “we expect faster clearances, faster guarantees of access.” He said WFP has already reached 1 million people with assistance. The goal is to reach 4 million in the coming months. On Tuesday, David Beasley, the head of the WFP, told the U.N. Security Council that the month-old war has turned Ukraine “from the breadbasket of the world to breadlines.” He told the Security Council that 50% of the grain it purchases to feed 125 million people around the globe comes from Ukraine, and warned that it will have to start cutting rations in war-torn areas like Yemen, which has already had its food allotment cut in half due to rising costs of food, fuel and shipping. Beasley said Ukraine and Russia combined produce 30% of the world’s wheat supply, 20% of its corn and between 75-90% of sunflower seed oil. Egypt and Lebanon alone receive just over 80% of its grain supplies from Ukraine. VOA has this story. 4:30 a.m.: Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Wednesday that his country is taking steps to end Russian oil imports by the end of this year, the Associated Press reported.

Morawiecki said he expects gas imports will be cut in May and called on other European countries to follow suit. 4:00 a.m.: A free and prosperous Indo-Pacific is more important than ever, President Joe Biden said while meeting with his Singaporean counterpart against the backdrop of a raging conflict in Ukraine, which Biden has painted as a global struggle between liberal democracy and autocracy.

Security Council immediately take measures to demilitarize the Chernobyl exclusion zone and introduce a special U.N. mission there to eliminate the risk of the repeat of a nuclear catastrophe,” she said. 3:15 a.m.: Germany’s economy minister said he is triggering the early warning level for gas supplies amid Russia’s continued demand to be paid in rubles, the AP reported. Robert Habeck told reporters Wednesday that this was the first of three warning levels and entails the establishment of a crisis team in his ministry that will heighten monitoring of the gas supply situation. Habeck said he took the measure after Moscow indicated it would require payment in rubles despite the Group of Seven countries rejecting such demands on Monday. He says Germany’s gas storages are currently filled to about 25% capacity. 2:50 a.m.: Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced Tuesday that the country hopes to open three humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians from besieged towns and cities, Reuters reported. She said this would include trying to establish a safe corridor for people to leave the encircled southern port city of Mariupol in private vehicles. The corridors are expected to be set up on Wednesday. 2:00 a.m.: The U.K. defense ministry said Wednesday that Russian unites have been forced to return to Belarus after suffering heavy losses in order to reorganize and resupply. The report further notes that as ground forces are pushed back, Russia “will likely continue to compensate for its reduced ground manoeuvre capability through mass artillery and missile strikes.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 30 March 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: https://t.co/ete9x5Ty71🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/202UH5Uz8t  1:30 a.m.: Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in China as Russia attempts to shore up support from its most powerful ally. Lavrov landed in Huangshan, an eastern city on Tuesday. He is scheduled to attend meetings on the topic of stabilizing Afghanistan with representatives from Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. A separate meeting of the “extended troika” will include representatives of the United States, China and Russia, Al Jazeera reported. The meetings will take place in the town of Tunxi, which is isolated from major population centers. The trip marks Lavrov’s first to China since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Prior to the visit Lavrov declared Russia-China relations were at their strongest ever, Reuters reported. 12:30 a.m.: Negotiations are expected to resume Wednesday, five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead and almost 4 million Ukrainians fleeing the country, The Associated Press reported. Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed skepticism Tuesday night about Russia’s announcement that it would significantly scale back military operations near Ukraine’s capital and a northern city. “Yes, we can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive. But those signals don’t silence the explosions of Russian shells,” Zelenskyy said. “Of course, we see the risks. Of course, we don’t see any basis for trusting the words voiced by those or other representatives of the state that is continuing to fight for our destruction. “Ukrainians are not naïve people,” Zelenskyy said. “Ukrainians have already learned during the 34 days of the invasion and during the past eight years of war in the Donbas that you can trust only concrete results.” 12:00 a.m.: Opponents of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine gathered in the U.S. state of Colorado to raise funds for displaced civilians and to remember those killed by Nazis during World War II.
