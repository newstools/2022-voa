Following a spate of real-world bans of Russian athletes from international competition over the country’s invasion of Ukraine, a popular video game company said Wednesday it would start removing Russian teams from some of its most popular products. EA Sports, which makes popular soccer and hockey video games, said it has “initiated processes" to remove the Russian national team and Russian clubs from its products. "In line with our partners at FIFA and UEFA, EA Sports has initiated processes to remove the Russian national team and all Russian clubs from EA Sports FIFA products including: FIFA 22, FIFA Mobile and FIFA Online,” the company said in a statement. “We're also actively evaluating related changes to other areas of our games.” The company added that it stands “in solidarity” with the Ukrainian people and called for an end to the invasion. According to the British newspaper The Mirror, there are three Russian club soccer teams in the FIFA 22 game, including CSKA Moscow, Lokomotiv Moscow and Spartak Moscow. The Russian men’s national soccer team is also available for video game players to choose. Following Russia’s invasion, many sports federations, including soccer, ice skating, tennis and others, banned or barred Russian athletes from competing using the national flag at competitions.
