Demonstrations are taking place in many locations across Russia on Sunday to protest Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine with more than 700 detained by police so far. OVD-Info, which monitors arrests during protests, said that, by 6:30 p.m. Moscow time, police had detained 745 people during demonstrations in 37 Russian cities. At least 353 of them had been arrested in Moscow, the independent monitor said. . An AFP journalist present at a protest in the capital Moscow witnessed at least a dozen arrests and said police were taking away anybody without press papers. A young woman was shouting "peace to the world" as she was taken away by two policemen, AFP reported. In Russia's second city, Saint Petersburg, AFP saw multiple arrests, including a protester being dragged across the ground. The city's central Nevsky Avenue was closed off by police with a dozen police vans parked along the road. Last weekend, police arrested more than 5,000 protesters across Russia. Protesters risk fines and possible prison sentences by taking to the streets. Since Russia launched its invasion on February 24, more than 14,200 people have been arrested in Russia for taking part in anti-war protests. Information from AP and AFP was used in this report.
