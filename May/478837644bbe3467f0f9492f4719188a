Iran's supreme leader will pardon or commute the jail sentences of 1,542 convicted prisoners in a gesture marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, his website said Saturday. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei "agreed to pardon or commute the sentences of 1,542 convicts" for the Eid al-Fitr holiday that marks the end of the holy month, it said. The supreme leader routinely grants collective pardons on major religious holidays, in coordination with the head of the judiciary. Eid al-Fitr starts on Monday in Iran.
