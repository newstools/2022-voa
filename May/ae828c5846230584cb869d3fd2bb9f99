The European Union on Monday accused Apple of abusing its dominant Apple Pay market position to prevent other companies from competing in contactless payment technologies. "Apple has built a closed ecosystem around its devices and its operating system, iOS. And Apple controls the gates to this ecosystem, setting the rules of the game for anyone who wants to reach consumers using Apple devices," EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. "By excluding others from the game, Apple has unfairly shielded its Apple Pay wallets from competition." The 27-nation bloc's executive arm, the European Commission, said Apple's practice "has an exclusionary effect on competitors and leads to less innovation and less choice for consumers for mobile wallets on iPhones." The commission has not disclosed what, if any, fines could be levied against Apple should it be found in violation of antitrust laws. In response, Apple said it would cooperate with the Commission. The company said it "will continue to engage with the Commission to ensure European consumers have access to the payment option of their choice in a safe and secure environment." The Commission has been investigating several aspects of Apple's business practices in Europe since 2020, including the possibility the company violates European antitrust laws over music streaming and the app store.
