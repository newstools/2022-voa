Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded in February and more than 20 million tons of grain are stuck in silos there. Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies and the lack of exports from Ukraine is contributing to a growing global food crisis. “Turkey is negotiating with both Russia and Ukraine for the export of grains from Ukraine,” the official told Reuters, requesting anonymity. “With a corridor to be opened from Turkey, there was a demand for this grain to reach their targeted markets. Negotiations are still ongoing.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko was quoted as saying on Wednesday that Moscow is ready to provide a corridor for vessels carrying food in return for lifting of some Western sanctions. Turkey neighbors Ukraine and Russia on the Black Sea. 5:02 a.m.: Al Jazeera reports that at least 431 civilians have been killed and 1,168 more wounded in the Donetsk region since the Russian invasion began. 4:20 a.m.: Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko called Ukraine the “key for freedom in the world” and urged for more support Thursday as his country faces what he called “this senseless war” with Russia. Klitschko said Ukraine is a peaceful country that was not aggressive toward anyone, and that Ukrainians want to be “part of the European family” with a priority on human rights, press freedom and “democratic standards of life.” Russia on the other hand, he said, wants to rebuild the Soviet Union and would not stop with a takeover of Ukraine. “We’re defending not just our family and our children, we’re defending you because we have the same values,” Klitschko said, adding that Russia will go as far as it is allowed to go. He thanked those who have supported Ukraine politically, economically and by sending weapons, and those who have taken in Ukrainians refugees. Noting that it has been more than 90 days since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Klitschko said it feels to him like “one long, long day.” 4 a.m.: Fighting in recent weeks has been focused in the eastern Donbas region where Russia has been trying to seize control after failing to topple Zelenskyy or capture Kyiv. The Ukrainian governor of the eastern region of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, described the situation around the industrial hub of Severodonetsk as “very difficult” and said there was “already fighting on the outskirts.” “Russian troops have advanced far enough that they can already fire mortars” on the city, he said.

The original proposal, backed by the United States and more than 40 other countries, condemns Russia’s actions but stops short of immediately suspending its voting rights at the U.N. health agency.

"The Ukrainian Main Intelligence Directorate (GUR) noted that up to 60% of Russia’s high-precision stockpile has already been exhausted," the Institute said in a recent update. Additionally, it said, Russia is trying to force Ukrainians in occupied areas to cooperate with "occupation organs" and is trying to get Ukrainians into the Russian army. 1:30 a.m.: British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to give a speech Thursday in which she plans to call on allies to continue support for Ukraine against Russian aggression.
