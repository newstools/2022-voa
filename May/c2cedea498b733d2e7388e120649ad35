The update notes that "it is not clear that the presence of these commanders on the battlefield has led to a refined or altered operational concept. Flawed planning assumptions and failures in sustainment continue to undermine Russian progress." 1:05 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says “nearly 200 cultural heritage sites already” had been destroyed or damaged since the Russian invasion began, The New York Times reports. 12:02 a.m.: Kyiv's mayor says it'll probably be safer for residents to return to the city after Monday, which is Russia's Victory Day, The Washington Post reports.
