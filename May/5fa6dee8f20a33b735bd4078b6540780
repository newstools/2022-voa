Ukraine’s top prosecutor says she has identified more than 600 Russians suspected of war crimes. Criminal prosecutions already have started for 80 of the suspects, which include “top military, politicians and propaganda agents of Russia," Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told a news conference in The Hague. Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia, Lithuania and Poland also are participating in the investigations, Venediktova said. In addition, the group is working with the International Criminal Court, which began looking into potential war crimes in March. "We should collect and protect everything in the right way. It should be acceptable evidence in any court," Venediktova said. Russia has consistently denied it has targeted civilians following its invasion of Ukraine on February 24.
