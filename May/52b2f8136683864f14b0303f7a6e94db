Australia's incoming Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Sunday he was planning on travelling to a Quad meeting in Japan to send a message on Australia's policy changes. The Quad group of countries consists of the United States, Japan, Australia and India. "The Quad leaders meeting is an absolute priority for Australia, and it enables us to send a message to the world that there is a change of government. There will be some changes in policy, particularly with regard to climate change and our engagement with the world on those issues," he told reporters from a cafe in Sydney's inner west, where he interacted with supporters and a local parliamentarian. Albanese added that on Monday five members of his Labor Party would be sworn in as ministers including himself as prime minister. Official results could be several days away, with the counting of a record 2.7 million postal votes to begin Sunday afternoon, two days earlier than prior elections.
