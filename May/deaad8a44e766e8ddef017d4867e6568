U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is calling on allies to boost their economic support for Ukraine, saying the support pledged so far will not be enough to meet the country’s basic needs. In comments prepared for the Brussels Economic Forum, Yellen says while Ukraine will eventually need “massive support,” for now it needs “budget funding to pay soldiers, employees and pensioners, as well as to operate an economy that meets its citizens' basic needs.” Yellen adds that Ukraine’s “financing needs are significant,” while crediting the bravery and ingenuity of the country’s officials to keep its economy going. Help could come Wednesday with the European Union expected to propose a set of loans that would help Ukraine both with short-term financing and its rebuilding effort in the longterm.
