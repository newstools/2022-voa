The husband of a fourth-grade teacher killed in this week's mass shooting at a Texas elementary school has died from a heart attack, family members told The New York Times. Joe Garcia was preparing for the funeral of Irma Garcia, his high school sweetheart and wife of 24 years, when he collapsed and died on Thursday, the newspaper reported. The two leave behind four children, according to the report.
Irma Garcia, 46, was one of two teachers killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, along with 19 children. Relatives briefed by authorities said Irma Garcia and her co-teacher Eva Mireles died trying to protect their students.
