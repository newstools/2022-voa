Myanmar’s military, which seized power in a coup last year, blamed opposition “terrorists” on Wednesday for a deadly bus stop bombing that happened a day earlier in Yangon. Members of the exiled government denied involvement and blamed the military.

The blast left at least one person dead and several others wounded.
Photos and video from the scene showed bleeding victims on the sidewalk near the blast.

A second fatal bomb blast occurred Tuesday at an education office in eastern Myanmar.

Myanmar has been the scene of much unrest since a military coup in February of 2021 led to nationwide protests and violent crackdowns on them by government forces. Some 1,400 have been reported killed.

While initial protests were peaceful, armed resistance against the military government has increased, prompting a warning from some United Nations experts that the country is at risk of a civil war.

"The world's attention may have moved away from Myanmar since last year's coup, but civilians continue to pay a high price," Rawya Rageh, Amnesty International's senior crisis adviser, said in a news release.
