The U.N. mission to Afghanistan says that “scores” of people were killed and wounded in an attack on a market in eastern Nangarhar province Monday, according to a Reuters report.

The Taliban confirmed only that 10 people had been wounded, the news agency said.

The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) posted on Twitter that there were children among the killed and wounded.

“Continuing attacks targeting civilians across Afghanistan must cease immediately,” UNAMA said.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

A regional affiliate of the Islamic State group, Islamic State Khorasan Province, has recently increased attacks against minority Shiite Muslim Afghans and other religious minorities, killing scores of people.

At least two people were killed and seven others wounded in an early Saturday morning militant assault on a minority Sikh temple in the capital, Kabul.

IS-Khorasan Province claimed responsibility for that assault.
