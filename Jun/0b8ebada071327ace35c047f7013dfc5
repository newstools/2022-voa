All times EDT: 8:16 a.m.: Egypt, Israel and the European Union on Wednesday signed a deal to increase liquified natural gas sales to EU countries, who aim to reduce their dependence on supplies from Russia as the war in Ukraine drags on, The Associated Press reported.

The deal, stamped in an upscale Cairo hotel, will see Israel send more gas via Egypt, which has facilities to liquify it for export by sea, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said. “What a special moment,” she said in a joint news conference alongside the Egyptian and Israel energy ministers. “I very warmly welcome the signing of this historic agreement.”

Von der Leyen, who visited Israel earlier this week, said the agreement was part of Europe’s efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russia and import hydrocarbons from “other trustworthy suppliers.” She named Israel and Egypt who have emerged as gas exporters in recent years following major offshore discoveries.

World Food Program, David Beasley, on Wednesday shared a video clip on Twitter from his interview with Swedish national public television broadcaster SVT, in which he appealed to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin to open Ukraine’s ports to allow food supplies to reach the rest of the world. “So I’m asking President Putin, if you have any heart at all...you can prevent famine by opening up those ports,” Beasley said. “Let those ports open, let us move our ships in and out, so we can reach the hundreds of millions of people around the world that depend upon grain from Ukraine and Russia,” he added. Q: Do you think ships carrying life-saving food will be able to leave Ukrainian ports?A: Well, if they don’t, it will be a declaration of war on global food security.#Ukraine @svt pic.twitter.com/Ot3wrc236b 7:29 a.m.: Europe has grappled with how to end its Russian energy addiction more than ever since Vladimir Putin launched his country's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February 24. But absent from sanctions, let alone discussion, is Rosatom, the Russian state-run nuclear power giant, despite a written appeal in the early days of the invasion from Ukrainian activists and NGOs to blacklist the company and ban nuclear fuel imported from Russia.

"Communication is essential, in the future we will still have to communicate," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a conference call on Wednesday, when asked about the state of U.S.-Russia relations.

"The U.S. is not going anywhere, Europe is not going anywhere, so somehow we will have to communicate with them." 6:43 a.m.: They have helped millions flee to safety, brought foreign leaders to Kyiv and transported countless metric tons of goods: for Ukraine, trains have played a crucial role in countering the Russian offensive, its railway chief said.

"Some say the railways have been like a second army," Oleksandr Kamyshin, head of Ukraine Railways, told Agence France-Presse in an interview. "When the war started, we had to react quickly so that's exactly what we did."

From the moment Russia attacked on February 24, the railways were essential for getting people to safety, Kamyshin said. "Since the start of the war, 3.8 million people were evacuated from the east and the south of Ukraine toward the west, and 600,000 people in the west toward neighboring countries," like Poland, Romania and Moldavia, he said. 6:38 a.m.: The U.N.

Intesa last month cut its profit guidance for the year after setting aside 800 million euros ($847 million) to cover potential losses from its exposure to Russia. 6:24 a.m.: President Joe Biden on Wednesday called on U.S. oil refiners to produce more gasoline and diesel, saying their profits have tripled during a time of war between Russia and Ukraine. “The crunch that families are facing deserves immediate action,” Biden wrote in the draft of a letter to oil refiners obtained by The Associated Press. “Your companies need to work with my Administration to bring forward concrete, near-term solutions that address the crisis.” President Biden called on U.S. oil refiners to produce more gasoline and diesel, saying their profits have tripled during a time of war between Russia and Ukraine as Americans struggle with record high prices at the pump. https://t.co/iIKJ3kFrMs 6:15 a.m.: NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters NATO defense ministers would meet late Wednesday with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov and get an update on “what Ukraine urgently needs.” Amid comments by Ukrainian officials that not enough military aid has come, and not quickly enough, Stoltenberg said such efforts take time but that NATO leaders realize the urgency and are working with Ukraine to overcome hurdles. Stoltenberg also said he expects NATO allies will also make new announcements of support for Ukraine on Wednesday. 5:10 a.m.: Reuters reported that some 2.4 million hectares of winter crops with a total value of $1.435 billion will remain unharvested in Ukraine because of Russia’s invasion, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Wednesday. It said the agriculture sector had so far suffered losses of $4.292 billion because of the invasion. It estimated that the number of animals killed in areas affected by fighting included 42,000 sheep and goats, 92,000 cows, 258,000 pigs and more than 5.7 million birds. 4:30 a.m.: Up to 1,200 civilians may be holed up in the shelters of the Azot chemical plant in the eastern Ukrainian city where one of the fiercest battles of the war has been raging between Russian and Ukrainian forces, Reuters reported citing a Russian-backed separatist. Russian forces are trying to grind down Ukrainian resistance in the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, part of a wider push to drive Kyiv’s forces out of two separatist regions which Russia backs and has recognized as independent states. Russia on Wednesday said it had opened a humanitarian corridor out of the sprawling ammonia factory founded under Soviet leader Josef Stalin, to a separatist-controlled town. “About 1,000 to 1,200 civilians of Sievierodonetsk may still be on the territory of the Azot chemical plant,” Rodion Miroshnik, an official in the Russian-backed self-styled separatist administration of the Luhansk People’s Republic, said on Telegram. Miroshnik said the civilians are in part of the plant that is still controlled by Ukrainian forces, which he said numbered up to 2,000 people including Ukrainian and foreign fighters. 4:10 a.m.: Higher oil prices and dimming economic forecasts are set to weigh on demand growth, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday, though the world’s thirst for oil is set to reach pre-pandemic levels in 2023, Reuters reported. “Economic fears persist, as various international institutions have recently released downbeat outlooks,” the Paris-based IEA said in its monthly oil report, providing its first demand prediction for next year. “Similarly, tightening central bank policy, the impact of a soaring U.S. dollar and rising interest rates on the purchasing power of emerging economies mean the risks to our outlook are concentrated on the downside.” Rising crude and fuel prices buoyed in part by sanctions on Russian supply in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine have helped push up inflation in some developed economies to 40-year highs, sparking fears of a possible recession. While advanced economies making up the OECD will account for most demand growth this year, China is due to lead the gains in 2023 as it emerges from lockdowns aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. 3:59 a.m.: President Emmanuel Macron voiced a tougher line on Russia on Wednesday after visiting French and allied troops at a NATO base in Romania, seeking to assuage concerns in Ukraine and among some European allies over his previous stance towards Moscow, Reuters reported. Macron arrived in Romania on Tuesday for a three-day trip to NATO’s southern flank including Moldova before possibly heading to Kyiv on Thursday on a visit with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, two diplomatic sources said. The French leader has been criticized by Ukraine and eastern European allies for what they perceived as his ambiguous backing for Ukraine in the war against Russia. French officials have in recent days sought to strengthen the public messaging, while Macron appeared to take a tougher line on Tuesday evening when he was with his troops. “We will do everything to stop Russia’s war forces, to help the Ukrainians and their army and continue to negotiate,” he told French and NATO troops at a military base in Romania. “But for the foreseeable future, we will need to protect, dissuade and be present,” he said. 2:10 a.m.: "Yes, Ukraine should have more heavy weapons," Stoltenberg told a press conference at The Hague after meeting with the leaders of seven European NATO allies ahead of a summit at the end of June.https://t.co/E01oHstteS  1:30 a.m.: Film icon and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger says “we have blood on our hands” condemning countries buying Russian fuel in this video shared by Agence France-Presse.

The talks are taking place on the sidelines of a NATO defense ministers meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels. A virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group last month drew representatives from nearly 50 nations and pledges of new aid packages. Ukrainian officials continue to urge international partners to send more weapons, especially heavy artillery, in order to help Ukrainian forces, match up against Russia. “The question is what do the Ukrainians need to continue the success they’ve already seen in slowing down and thwarting that Russian objective and that’ll be a major focus for the defense ministers,” a senior U.S. defense official said ahead of Wednesday’s meeting. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday that Ukraine “should have more heavy weapons.” He said Ukraine’s forces “absolutely depend on that to be able to stand up against the brutal Russian invasion.” 12:01 a.m.: Russian forces push to gain full control of the eastern industrial city of Sievierodonetsk, located in the Donbas region that Russia has declared to be its main focus of its operation in Ukraine. “Hanging in there in Donbas is crucial,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video message late Tuesday. “Donbas is the key to deciding who will dominate in the coming weeks.” Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.
