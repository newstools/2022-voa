She won't apologize for her diplomatic efforts, AP reported. In her first substantial comments since leaving office six months ago, Merkel said there was no excuse for Russia's brutal attack on Ukraine and it was “a big mistake on Russia's part.” Merkel, who dealt with Russian President Vladimir Putin throughout her chancellorship, rejected a suggestion that she and others engaged in appeasement that ultimately enabled the invasion. “It is a matter of great sorrow that it didn't succeed, but I don't blame myself now for trying,” Merkel said.
