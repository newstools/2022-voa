Global reported cases of COVID-19 cases and deaths “are near their lowest levels since the beginning of the pandemic,” the World Health Organization director-general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Friday. Speaking at the GLOBSEC Bratislava Forum, Tedros warned, however, that “It is still far too early to say the pandemic is over. ... Increasing transmission, plus decreasing testing and sequencing, plus 1 billion people still unvaccinated, equals a dangerous situation.” “There remains a real and present danger, the WHO chief said, “of a new and more virulent variant emerging that evades our vaccines.” Meanwhile, India’s health ministry reported a slight dip in COVID-19 cases Saturday, with 3,962 new cases. On Friday, however, the daily count crossed 4,000 for the first time in about three months. Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center has recorded more than 43 million COVID cases in India with over 500,000 deaths. The global COVID infection toll is more than 531 million with 6.3 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. The center reported a total of 11.66 billion vaccines administered.
