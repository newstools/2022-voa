Legislators in Macau approved a landmark casino bill on Tuesday, the biggest reforms in more than two decades, ahead of an expected casino license bidding process in the world's biggest gambling hub. The changes - marking the first major reforms since casinos were first liberalized in 2002 - mean far greater oversight and control by the government into casino operations in Macau. The vote came as the Chinese special administrative region carries out mass COVID-19 testing of its more than 600,000 population after dozens of locally transmitted cases were found in recent days. A hotel and casino resort on Macau's main peninsula was locked down by authorities on Tuesday due to a coronavirus infection, with some 700 people forced to quarantine. Macau's legislature released a final draft of a highly anticipated gaming bill last week, fixing casino tax to 40% from 39% currently and giving officials far greater oversight into casino operations. The 55-page document, released in Portuguese and Chinese on the legislature's website, comes as the government is due to formally sign a six-month license extension for casino operators this week.
