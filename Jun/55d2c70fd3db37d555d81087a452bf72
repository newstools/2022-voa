While inflation is high – about 17 percent – there are indications that manufacturing n Russia expanded in May. The Times says high energy prices are the main reason the Russian economy is (for now) weathering the sanctions. 3:30 a.m.: The British military intelligence report said Saturday that Russian bombers have likely been launching 1960s-era heavy, anti-ship missiles meant to destroy aircraft carriers with nuclear warheads against land targets in Ukraine. The 5.5-ton Kh-22 missiles, when used in ground attacks with conventional warheads, are highly inaccurate and can cause severe collateral damage and casualties, the daily battleground intelligence report added.

In total, the office said that at least 287 children have died since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24th. More than 492 have been wounded. “During the recording of criminal offenses, it has become known that 24 more children died in Mariupol, Donetsk region, as a result of the indiscriminate shelling by the Russian military,” the office said on the Telegram messaging app. “These figures are not final, as work is underway to establish them in places of active hostilities, in the temporarily occupied and liberated territories.” Reuters reported that it was not able to independently verify the information. 2:58 a.m.: AP Photos: In the midst of war, life goes on in Ukraine. @AP_Images https://t.co/S4z0VDyobG 1:41 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country needs more heavy weapons from allies, because Russia aims to destroy every city in Ukraine's Donbas region, according to Al Jazeera. "Every city – that’s not an exaggeration," Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. "Like Volnovakha, like Mariupol. All of these ruins of once-happy cities, the black traces of fires, the craters from explosions – this is all that Russia can give to its neighbors, to Europe, to the world." "The Ukrainian troops are doing everything to stop the offensive of the occupiers, as much as is possible. As much as the heavy weapons, modern artillery – all that we have asked for and continue to ask for from our partners – allow them," he said. 12:33 a.m.: U.S. President Joe Biden told donors at a Democratic fundraiser Friday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "didn’t want to hear it" when U.S. intelligence gathered information that Russia was preparing to invade, according to The Associated Press. "Nothing like this has happened since World War II," Biden said. "I know a lot of people thought I was maybe exaggerating." "There was no doubt,” Biden said. "And Zelenskyy didn't want to hear it." Although Zelenskyy has inspired people with his leadership during the war, his preparation for the invasion — or lack thereof — has remained a controversial issue. In the weeks before the war began on Feb. 24, Zelenskyy publicly bristled as Biden administration officials repeatedly warned that a Russian invasion was highly likely. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.
