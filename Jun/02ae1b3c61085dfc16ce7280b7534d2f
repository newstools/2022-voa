British golfer Matt Fitzpatrick held onto a one-shot lead on the final hole Sunday to win the U.S. Open. The victory at The Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts was the first major title for the 27-year-old from Sheffield, England. He won the U.S. Amateur at the same course in 2013. Sunday’s win netted Fitzpatrick $3.15 million. By shooting a two-under-par 68 in the final round, including a dramatic par on the 18th hole, Fitzpatrick held off Americans Scottie Sheffler and Will Zalatoris, who tied for second place. Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama finished fourth, while American Collin Morikawa and Britain’s Rory McIlroy tied for fifth place.
