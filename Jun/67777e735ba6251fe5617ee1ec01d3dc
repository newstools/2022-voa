Colombian officials said four people died and more than 300 were injured in Sunday’s collapse of a grandstand at a bullfight in the city of El Espinal. President Ivan Duque said he would order an investigation and expressed solidarity with the families of the victims. The collapse happened during a traditional event in which members of the public enter the ring to engage the bulls. Several officials, including president-elect Gustavo Petro, called for such events to be banned. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.
