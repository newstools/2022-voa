All times EDT: 9:08 a.m.: U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a “massive act of aggression,” was a major topic during the Global Chiefs of Mission Conference in Washington on Tuesday. Speaking at the State Department to VOA’s Russian service, Sullivan said, “I think it's important to understand the scale of the problem and what the Russian government has done through its actions. Almost 15 million people are either refugees, have left Ukraine or they're internally displaced persons. We've heard the casualty statistics — thousands upon thousands of innocent people, men women and children killed, but millions of refugees.” 8:47 a.m.: Kateryna Melekheda and her two children found refuge in the Czech Republic after fleeing their home in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv following Russia's invasion of their country. But when her temporary accommodation in Prague was about to expire, Melekheda was desperate to find somewhere else to stay. That's when a Czech lawyer stepped in with a generous offer of help. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Stuart Greer, Darab Gajar, and Roman Kupka have this story.  8:26 a.m.: Russian forces pounded Ukraine's second largest city Kharkiv and surrounding countryside with rockets, killing at least 15 people, in what Kyiv called a bid to force it to pull resources from the main battlefield to protect civilians from attack, Reuters reported. The Russian strikes on Kharkiv, throughout Tuesday and continuing on Wednesday morning, were the worst for weeks in the area where normal life had been returning since Ukraine pushed Russian forces back in a major counter-offensive last month. "Russian forces are now hitting the city of Kharkiv in the same way that they previously were hitting Mariupol - with the aim of terrorizing the population," Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video address. In the main battlefield city of Sievierodonetsk, where Russia has claimed to have Ukrainian forces surrounded since last week, pictures filmed by a freelance journalist made clear the battle was not over, with Ukrainian troops able to resupply their garrison by crossing a river in inflatable rafts. 8:12 a.m.: ⚡️Russian forces attack Sievierodonetsk from all directions. Russian troops are attacking Ukrainian soldiers along the entire frontline, throwing all their forces into the city, according to Mayor Oleksandr Striuk. “It is quite difficult," he said.  8:01 a.m.: Russian appeals against bans from international soccer because of the country’s war in Ukraine are set to be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in July, The Associated Press reported. The court on July 5 will hear the Russian soccer federation’s appeal against FIFA and UEFA’s joint decision to suspend its national and club teams days after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. A second CAS hearing on July 11 will consider an appeal by four Russian clubs, including national champion Zenit St. Petersburg, against exclusion from the next UEFA club competitions. Urgent verdicts could be requested by the clubs ahead of scheduled games in qualifying rounds of the Champions League and other UEFA competitions. The high-profile soccer cases could set the tone for similar appeal cases pending at CAS between Russia and governing bodies of Olympic sports. 7:54 a.m.: Ukraine’s Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov on Wednesday welcomed the announcement of a new relationship with the 3 Seas Initiative (3SI). Polish president Andrzej Duda announced Tuesday that the 3 Seas Initiative member states have granted Ukraine participating partner status, saying it would help Ukraine to develop cooperation with 3SI in energy and transport. The primary goal of the initiative is “to boost economic growth and resilience of the region by developing transport, energy and digital infrastructure,” according to the organization, and its members include twelve European countries located between the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas.

The airborne operation conducted on Tuesday night and dubbed Thunder Lynx “enabled, at very short notice, the dropping of about 100 paratroopers” from France’s 11th Airborne Brigade “over an area secured by Estonian soldiers,” the statement said. The hastily organized exercise in Estonia, a NATO ally, was executed as an act of “strategic solidarity” amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. “The airborne operation illustrates the ability of the French armed forces to intervene, in emergency, and support an allied country,” a French defense ministry statement said. France was one of the first countries to send its troops to Europe’s eastern flank following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24. 7:41 a.m.: Going to the dentist is never a welcome task, but for Russians living under sanctions imposed by the West on their country for its invasion of Ukraine, it’s now even harder to stomach, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported. The Russian dental industry is almost entirely dependent on European and U.S. imports of equipment and materials, and now, facing a virtually frozen supply chain, dentists are scrambling to weigh the alternatives of potentially inferior treatments for patients -- and having to raise prices. “I still remember what Soviet dentistry is. I remember those yellow fillings and iron teeth. No thank you. I don’t want to return to the U.S.S.R.,” says one woman awaiting dental implants.https://t.co/8di67E2OA2  7:34 a.m.: Lawmakers in Bulgaria are set to vote Wednesday on a no-confidence motion against the country’s coalition government. If approved, the motion could topple the centrist prime minister and further stall efforts by Balkan countries to join the European Union, The Associated Press reported. The center-right opposition GERB party filed the motion last week, citing the government’s handling of public finances and economic policy in the face of rising inflation. Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has prompted the EU to consider speeding up its membership drive in the Western Balkans, where Moscow still wields considerable influence. 7:07 a.m.: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Georgian Service spoke to prominent French intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy, a renowned author, philosopher, and war correspondent. Levy has been a regular visitor to Ukraine since the country's 2014 revolution that overthrew pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. He has addressed crowds on Kyiv's Independence Square in 2014 and 2015, reported from the Donbas front lines, and publicly supported Ukraine's acceptance into Euro-Atlantic structures. The author of a new documentary in which he visits the world's trouble spots, including Ukraine, Levy says Zelenskyy is "one of the founding fathers of Europe" whereas Vladimir Putin is merely a "bad chess player." 6:55 a.m.: A draft of the final declaration for this week's European Union summit proposes candidate status for Ukraine and Moldova, a copy of the document seen by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty shows. Within the European Union "there is not a single country that has problems" with the move, Luxembourg's Jean Asselborn said before a meeting EU foreign ministers. The unprecedented move by the European body comes as Kyiv fights a devastating war against Russia, which launched an unprovoked invasion of its neighbor on February 24 that has killed tens of thousands of people and caused huge material destruction.https://t.co/DIqFgVsYRr  6:51 a.m.: Nearly two-thirds of Europeans consider membership of the European Union a "good thing", according to a survey by the bloc's parliament published on Wednesday, marking the highest result in 15 years. Most countries showed significantly more positive attitudes towards EU membership compared to a survey conducted at the end of last year, the European Parliament said in a statement, notably in the Baltic States of Lithuania and Estonia. "With war returning to our continent, Europeans feel reassured to be part of the European Union," added the parliament's president Roberta Metsola. The survey showed that only one in 10 respondents saw Russia positively compared to one in three in 2018. 6:44 a.m.: After a Russian rocket attack, not much was left of a home in the eastern Ukrainian village of Moshchun where one elderly resident had sheltered a group of neighbors.

The Nordic country has built up a substantial arsenal. But aside from the military hardware, General Timo Kivinen said, a crucial factor is that Finns would be motivated to fight. “The most important line of defense is between one's ears, as the war in Ukraine proves at the moment,” Kivinen said in an interview. Finland fought two wars in the 1940s against its eastern neighbor, with which it shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border. 6 a.m.: A Ukrainian photojournalist and a soldier who was accompanying him when they were killed in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion appear to have been “coldly executed” as they were searching Russian-occupied woodlands for the photographer’s missing image-taking drone, Reporters Without Borders said Wednesday, citing its findings from an investigation into their deaths. The Associated Press has the story. Reporters Without Borders says a Ukrainian photojournalist and a soldier who was accompanying him were “coldly executed” in Russia-occupied woodlands in the first weeks of the invasion.

Moscow denies responsibility for the food crisis and blames Western sanctions for the shortage. 4:30 a.m.: Russian reduction of gas flows to Europe are “very rogue moves” a senior European Commission said on Wednesday, saying plans to step up coal use in the bloc would be temporary and climate goals remained intact, according to Reuters. “The unlawful invasion by Russia of Ukraine has resulted in an emergency situation in the EU,” Elina Bardram, acting director for International Affairs and Climate Finance at the European Commission, told the Africa Energy Forum in Brussels. “With the very rogue moves we are observing from the Putin administration in terms Gazprom lowering the flow very suddenly, we are doing some very important measures, but all of those measures are temporary,” she added, referring to coal use. 3:55 a.m.: Reuters reported that members of the Russian delegation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or the OSCE, were denied British visas to attend the next session, Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy head of Russian upper house’s international affairs committee, said on Wednesday. 3:20 a.m.: South Korea plans to set up a delegation to NATO in Brussels, the national security adviser said on Wednesday, as Seoul pushes to strengthen its partnership with the organization and play a bigger role on the global stage, Reuters reported. Speaking to reporters about President Yoon Suk-yeol's planned attendance at a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting this month, National Security Adviser Kim Sung-han said Seoul would seek to bolster relations with NATO members in the face of an “unpredictable” international situation. As part of the efforts, South Korea is talking with NATO about information sharing, combined exercises and joint research to counter emerging security threats, he said. Yoon, inaugurated in May, has said his main foreign policy goal is to make South Korea a “global pivotal state” with a focus on promoting freedom, peace and prosperity based on its liberal democratic values. Although the June 29-30 meeting in Madrid is expected to focus on the Ukraine crisis, Yoon plans to drum up international cooperation against North Korea’s nuclear program, Kim said. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had said the upcoming summit is expected to agree on an assistance package for Ukraine that will help the country move from old Soviet-era weaponry to NATO standard gear. 2:25 a.m.: Current Time TV’s Borys Sachalko reports from a conflict zone near Izyum.

The day is also commemorated in Ukraine and Belarus, then part of the Soviet Union. The war there lasted 1,418 days from June 22, 1941, and historians estimate 27 million Soviet soldiers and civilians died. The Ukrainian government and its Western backers say Russian President Vladimir Putin has used the false pretext of removing Nazis from Ukraine to wage an unprovoked war of aggression. The Russian defense ministry released documents on Wednesday that date from the start of WWII and purport to show Germany intended to claim the Soviet army was bombing churches and cemeteries to justify its invasion. "Just as nowadays, in 1941, the Nazis prepared provocations in advance to discredit our state," Russia's defense ministry said. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.
