Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived Thursday in Hong Kong ahead of celebrations marking 25 years since the city was turned over from Britain to China. Xi arrived by high-speed train on what is believed to be his first trip outside of mainland China since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The July 1 handover anniversary was long marked by protests, but such demonstrations are not expected this year amid high security and the ongoing pandemic. China has cracked down since mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019, including the imposition of a sweeping national security law. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.
