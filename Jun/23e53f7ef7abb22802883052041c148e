Drugmaker Moderna says it has developed an experimental COVID-19 vaccine that combines its original shot with additional protection against the omicron variant of the coronavirus.

In an early study, Moderna said the shot, called mRNA-1273.214, offered a further boost against omicron when compared to just having a fourth dose of the original vaccine.

"We believe strongly that this data supports an update of the vaccine," Dr. Stephen Hoge, Moderna's president, said Wednesday.

The development comes as U.S. regulators and the World Health Organization consider potential new vaccine formulas for new rounds of boosters later this year when another surge in COVID-19 could come.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will meet in June to evaluate new formulas.

Pfizer is also reportedly developing a combination vaccine.
