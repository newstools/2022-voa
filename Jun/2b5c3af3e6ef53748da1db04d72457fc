The report said Russia’s troops and mainly its Western Group of forces “have likely made small advances in the Kharkiv sector for the first time in several weeks.” The report also predicted that Russia would increase its state defense spending, however, that its defense “industry could struggle to meet many of these requirements, partially due to the effects of sanctions and lack of expertise.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 14 June 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: https://t.co/yLAMUTwSGK🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/R1qjlpdsue  2:05 a.m.: Pope Francis refused the distinction between “good and bad” in the war in Ukraine, Reuters reported, citing La Stampa, a daily Italian newspaper.

Although the war in Ukraine is driving up farms’ selling prices, especially for grains, those rises are needed to offset higher input costs, according to Rabobank, which conducted the survey. The study found that about 50% of Australian farmers believed the war in Ukraine would hurt farm businesses. Only 28% expected business conditions to improve in the next 12 months, compared with 31% in the previous quarter. Overall, farmers expected their incomes to be stable for the coming 12 months. 12:01 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the battle for the Donbas region “will surely go down in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe … for us, the price of this battle is very high. It is just scary,” Zelenskyy said late Monday. He added a repeated call for partner countries to send Ukraine modern artillery to use against Russian forces.
