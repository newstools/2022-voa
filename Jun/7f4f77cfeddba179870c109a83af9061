A congressional panel investigating the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol is holding a surprise hearing Tuesday “to present recently obtained evidence and receive witness testimony.” A committee statement announcing the hearing did not identify the witness or witnesses, nor additional details about the evidence it would present. Tuesday’s hearing is a surprise because the committee had said its next hearings would come in July, with those focusing on domestic extremists who breached the Capitol and the actions of former President Donald Trump as the attack went on. Trump supporters stormed the Capitol as lawmakers were meeting to certify President Joe Biden’s win in the 2020 election. Five previous committee hearings have used video of the attack, taped testimony and live interviews to show how Trump and his allies sought to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence, the Justice Department and state officials certifying the election results. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.
