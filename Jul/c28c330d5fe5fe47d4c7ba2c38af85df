Russia resumed the flow of natural gas through the Nord Stream pipeline to Europe on Thursday after a 10-day interruption for maintenance. Klaus Mueller, head of Germany's energy regulator, tweeted that gas flows had reached 40% of capacity, the same level as before the shutdown. Russia’s state-owned Gazprom blamed the reduction on the absence of a gas turbine being repaired in Canada. Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted Gazprom would meet its delivery obligations, while warning that work on another turbine later this month could bring more reductions. European Union leaders have warned of the potential for Russia to cut off supplies in response to Western pressure on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. The EU has asked member countries to voluntarily reduce their use of gas, both to seek alternative options and to save existing supplies for winter months. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.
