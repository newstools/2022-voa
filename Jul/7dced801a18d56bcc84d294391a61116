A vigil was held in Tokyo Monday evening for former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a day before his funeral.

The suspect — 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami — is a former member of the country’s Self-Defense Forces. The suspect — 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami — is a former member of the country’s Self-Defense Forces. Police say Yamagami believed Abe was connected with a religious group that Yamagami blames for his mother’s financial ruin. South Korea’s Unification Church said Monday that Yamagami’s mother was a member, but denied taking large sums from her. Neither the suspect nor Abe was a member of the church, but apparently Yamagami believed Abe was. Abe had, however, supported the church’s peace-promoting efforts over the years. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.
