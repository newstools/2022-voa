Swedish prosecutors announced Wednesday they charged an 18-year-old man with two counts of murder in connection with a March attack at a high school. Authorities say the man armed with a knife and an axe killed two teachers at Malmo Latin School. The man was a student at the school, which has about 1,100 students. He was arrested shortly after the attack and is due to go on trial later this month. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.
