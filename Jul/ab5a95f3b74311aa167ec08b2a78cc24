All times EDT: 2:10 a.m.  1:10 a.m.: Germany will completely stop buying Russian coal on August 1 and Russian oil on December 31, marking a major shift in the source of the country's energy supply, deputy finance minister Joerg Kukies said at a conference in Sydney. The key challenge ahead will be filling the huge gap that will be left when the European Union weans itself off the 158 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year of gas that Russia supplies, Kukies said. Germany is rapidly developing liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals to help fill the gas supply gap, but he highlighted that while the United States and Qatar could together supply around 30 bcm of gas in LNG form to Europe, that still left a huge gap. 12:01 a.m.: Lithuania expanded trade restriction on passing through its territory to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, affecting about 15% of the cargo from Russia to Kaliningrad.
