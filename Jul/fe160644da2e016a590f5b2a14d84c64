Schools in Sri Lanka will be closed for another week, beginning Monday, officials, say. The cash-strapped country is in a financial crisis and is struggling to pay its bills, including for food, medicine, and fuel. Officials say there is not enough fuel to transport teachers and students to their classrooms. Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera is asking the country’s ex-patriates to send money home through banks to finance new oil purchases. Wijesekera said workers’ remittances usually total $600 million a month, but dropped to $318 million in June. Sri Lanka owes about $800 million to seven fuel suppliers, according to an Associated Press report. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.
