Sirens warned residents in southern Israel of an incoming rocket attack from Gaza early Saturday. Israel said four rockets were launched toward Israel. One was intercepted, while the other three fell to open space, according to the military. The Israel Defense Force said it retaliated with a fighter jet attack, targeting two Hamas sites. One site the IDF said, was a Hamas “underground complex containing raw materials used for the manufacturing of rockets.” Hamas is the militant Islamic group that governs the Gaza Strip. The attack comes just hours after U.S. President Joe Biden left Israel, a stop on his current Mideast tour with a goal of deepening Israel’s integration into the region. Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesperson, told Reuters that the Israeli attacks on Gaza “reflected U.S. support and encouragement the Zionist entity had received to pursue its aggression and crimes.” Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.
