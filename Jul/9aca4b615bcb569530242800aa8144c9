Authorities in South Africa have arrested the owner of a bar and two employees in connection with the deaths of 21 teenagers, who lost their lives at a tavern last month under mysterious circumstances. Vicky Stark reports from Cape Town, South Africa. A team of detectives working on the case made the arrests. Officials say the three suspects face charges of violating the liquor act, while a forensic investigation into the cause of the deaths continues. The two employees, ages 33 and 34, have been fined $118, while the owner must appear in court for his alleged role in selling alcohol to minors. The 21 youths, the youngest of whom was just 13 years old, died in the early hours of Sunday, June 26. Some had been celebrating the end of mid-year exams. There is speculation they ingested something poisonous or were the victims of a gas leak. Others at the tavern made it to a hospital, where they were treated for headaches and vomiting and discharged after observation. Police have appealed for patience as the investigation continues. The 52-year-old bar owner will appear in the East London Magistrate's Court in Eastern Cape Province on August 19.
