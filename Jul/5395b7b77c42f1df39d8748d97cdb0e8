Tropical Storm Colin has weakened as it moves over eastern North Carolina, just as U.S. residents are preparing their July Fourth celebrations. The National Hurricane Center reports there are no coastal warnings or watches in effect. The Center advises, however, that gusty winds are still possible over the Outer Banks Sunday morning. Scattered showers and thunderstorms could impact coastal North Carolina Sunday, according to the Center, but most locations will receive less than two centimeters of additional rainfall. The Hurricane Center, however, has warned that swells are still affecting portions of North Carolina’s coast and could possibly cause “life-threatening surf and rip current conditions” through Sunday evening.
