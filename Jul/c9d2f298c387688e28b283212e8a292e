All times EDT.  3:30 a.m.: According to a report released by The Kyiv Independent in Telegram, Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said a Russian strike hit a residential area of the city on July 26. There is no information about casualties. 2:30 a.m.: Russia said it will cut gas supplies to Europe from Wednesday in a blow to countries that have backed Ukraine, while missile attacks in Black Sea coastal regions raised doubts about whether Russia will stick to a deal to let Ukraine export grain, Reuters reported. The first ships from Ukraine may set sail in days under a deal agreed on Friday, the United Nations said, despite a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian port of Odesa over the weekend, and a spokesman for the military administration in the saying another missile had hit the Odesa region on Tuesday morning. Soaring energy costs and the threat of hunger faced by millions in low- and middle-income countries show how the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II, now in its sixth month, is having an impact far beyond Ukraine. European Union countries are set to approve on Tuesday a weakened emergency proposal to curb their gas demand as they try to wean themselves off Russian energy and prepare for a possible total cut-off. 2 a.m.: Britain said on Tuesday there was “no indication” that a Ukrainian warship and a stock of anti-ship missiles were at the dock-side in Odesa port on Sunday, after Russia earlier said it had destroyed those targets with high-precision missiles. “Russia will continue to prioritize efforts to degrade and destroy Ukraine’s anti-ship capability. However, Russia’s targeting processes are highly likely routinely undermined by dated intelligence, poor planning, and a top-down approach to operations,” the British Ministry of Defense said in a regular intelligence update. Ukrainian military has said two Kalibr missiles fired from Russian warships hit the area of a pumping station at the Odesa port and two others were shot down by air defense forces.

Last Saturday, Russia struck another southern Ukrainian port of Odesa, casting doubt on a plan to restart Ukrainian grain exports. The grain deal aims to allow safe passage for grain shipments in and out of Ukrainian ports, blockaded by Russia since its February 24 invasion. Russia has blamed Ukraine for stalling shipments by mining the port waters. 1:05 p.m.: Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia has lost about 39,700 of its troops.https://t.co/FNLoiKBz3p  12:15 a.m.: Starlink, a satellite based broadband service founded by Elon Musk, provides internet access to Ukrainians since Russia’s invasion. As of now we have over 12K Starlinks in Ukraine. They help with access to high-quality internet in difficult conditions. Still we are wondering of all possible ways to use @SpaceX tech. Our telecom team made Starlink test drive on the road at a speed of 130 km/h. Check the video: pic.twitter.com/cg0ltM1PIJ  Some information in this report came from Reuters.
