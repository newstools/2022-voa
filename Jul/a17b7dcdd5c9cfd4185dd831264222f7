A climber from Nepal reached the top of Pakistan’s Gasherbrum II mountain Thursday, setting a new record by scaling all the world’s 14 tallest peaks — all higher than 8,000 meters — for a second time.

Sanu Sherpa, 47, successfully summited the world’s 13th highest mountain at 8,035 meters above sea level early in the morning, said a spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP).

“A huge congratulations to Sanu Sherpa. This is a new world record in the mountaineering history,” ACP Secretary Karrar Haidri told VOA.

Haidri added that a few weeks ago the Nepalese climber also scaled Pakistan’s Nanga Parbat, the ninth-highest mountain on Earth at 8,126 meters.

Sherpa's Pioneer Adventure hiking company in the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, also confirmed his achievement. "He is the only person in the world to scale each of the 14 highest mountains twice," Nibesh Karki, the company's executive director told Reuters.

Nepal hosts eight of the 14 highest peaks on Earth, including the world’s tallest, Mount Everest; five others are in Pakistan, including the world’s second-tallest, K2, and one along the border of Nepal and the Tibetan region of China.

Sherpa has successfully summited Everest seven times and K2 twice. A team of 10 Nepalese climbers made history in January 2021 when they became the first in winter to reach the summit of Pakistan’s K2. The peak at 8,611 meters was the last of the 14 tallest mountains to be scaled in wintertime.
