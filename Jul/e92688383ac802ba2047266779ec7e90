Seven children were killed in a blast in northern Togo. The circumstances surrounding the explosion late Saturday into Sunday were not immediately clear. An investigation is underway “to determine the circumstances of this explosion and identify the perpetrators,” the army said Sunday. Eight soldiers were killed in the region in late May. The country declared a state of emergency in the northern region following the attack.
