Boris Johnson announced his resignation on Thursday, triggering a search for a new British leader. Below is how the process to find Johnson's successor will work: How long will it all take? The duration of the leadership contest can vary, depending on how many people put themselves forward. Theresa May became leader less than three weeks after David Cameron resigned in 2016 and all other contenders dropped out mid-race. Johnson faced former health minister Jeremy Hunt in the run-off ballot of Conservative members to replace May in 2019 and took office two months after May announced her intention to resign. Speaking outside Downing Street, Johnson said he would remain in office until a new prime minister is elected, but some Conservative members of parliament want Johnson to be replaced immediately.
