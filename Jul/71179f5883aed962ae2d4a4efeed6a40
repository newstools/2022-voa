All times EDT: 1:27 a.m.: The Institute for the Study of War, a U.S. think tank, said in its latest assessment of the Ukraine conflict that Russia is likely to complete the capture of the entire Luhansk Oblast. Ukrainian forces, meanwhile, are likely planning to use Western-supplied weapons to attack Russian ground lines of communication throughout Kharkiv Oblast, the assessment said. 12:02 a.m.: Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Russian forces have crossed the Siverskiy Donets river and were approaching Lysychansk from the north, Reuters reported. "If Lysychansk is taken, strategically it becomes more difficult for the Russians to continue their offensive,” he said. "The front lines will be flatter and there will be a frontal attack rather than from the flanks." He said the Russians would have to focus on taking six major cities in the industrialized eastern Donbas region and with each their forces would be more and more thinly spread. "The more Western weapons come to the front, the more the picture changes in favor of Ukraine," he said.
