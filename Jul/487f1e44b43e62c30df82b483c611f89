Millions of Canadians found out Friday what it is like to live without access to the internet and mobile phone service. Rogers Communications, the country’s largest mobile and internet provider, experienced a major outage, beginning Friday morning and lasting most of the day. The outage affected retailers, credit card and debit transactions, court proceedings, government agencies, calls to emergency services and much more. “Today we have let you down," Rogers posted on Twitter, without offering an explanation. “We are working to make this right as quickly as we can. We will continue to keep you updated, including when services will be back online." Late Friday, the Toronto-based telecommunications firm said it had begun restoring services.
