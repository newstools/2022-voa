The prime minister’s office says Johnson made the comment during a phone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

According to a statement, Zelenskyy outlined his country’s current military situation, and Johnson updated Zelenskyy on the latest British military contributions to Ukraine. He said these included 10 self-propelled artillery systems and loitering munitions, a type of aerial weapon. He said the weapons will arrive in coming days and weeks. 8:50 a.m.: Russian forces struck targets across Ukraine’s Donetsk region on Tuesday ahead of an expected offensive aimed at seizing more territory, reports Reuters.

Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of Donetsk, said Tuesday that the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk came under shelling overnight. “There is no safe place without shelling in the Donetsk region,” he said.

Russian forces captured the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk on Sunday, a move that gave Russia complete control of the neighboring Luhansk region. Ukrainian forces which retreated from Lysychansk have taken up new defensive lines in Donetsk, according to Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk. 8:00 a.m.: The mayor of a city in eastern Ukraine has advised residents to evacuate ahead of an expected Russian assault, reports the Associated Press.

Vadim Lyakh, mayor of Sloviansk in Donetsk province, said “it's important to evacuate as many people as possible” after Russian shelling damaged 40 houses in the city on Monday.

Russia declared its forces had taken full control of Ukraine’s Luhansk province on Monday and analysts believe it will next try to take Donetsk, the other part of the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas industrial region. 7:45 a.m.: Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev says a proposal to cap the price of Russian oil at about half its current level would cause world oil prices to triple, according to Reuters.

G7 leaders agreed at their recent meeting in Germany to examine the idea of an oil price cap in order to put a financial squeeze on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

Writing on social media Tuesday, Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, said the proposal would lead to significantly less oil on the market and could push prices above $300 or even $400 a barrel. 7:15 a.m.: Turkey has agreed to allow Sweden and Finland to join NATO on the condition that the two Nordic countries extradite people the Turkish government views as terrorists, reports Bloomberg.

Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on the eve of a NATO gathering in Brussels Tuesday that Turkey was still willing to block Sweden and Finland’s membership if they renege on those commitments. Turkey renews its threat to veto NATO membership for Sweden and Finland even as the security alliance prepared to formally begin an accession process that would bolster its eastern front against Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine has accused Russia, the world’s largest wheat exporter, of stealing grain from territories that Russia’s army has seized. Moscow denies this. The war has disrupted Ukraine’s grain exports via the Black Sea. TASS cited Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the Russian-installed administration of the Zaporizhzhia region, as saying the planned deals included sales to Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Balitsky said there was a contract to supply 150,000 tons of grain to Iran, adding that Russian agricultural traders and state companies were buying grain from the region’s farmers. Reuters said it could not verify the statement. 6 a.m.: Map showing the situation in #Ukraine as of July 5 at 0700 GMT #AFPgraphics @AFP pic.twitter.com/3IFpdTbFuX  5:45 a.m.: NATO's 30 allies signed an accession protocol for Finland and Sweden on Tuesday to allow them to join the nuclear-armed alliance once allied parliaments ratify the decision, the most significant expansion of the alliance since the mid-1990s. "This is truly an historic moment," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said alongside the foreign ministers of the two countries. "With 32 nations around the table, we will be even stronger." The protocol means Helsinki and Stockholm can participate in NATO meetings and have greater access to intelligence but will not be protected by the NATO defense clause that an attack on one ally is an attack against all until ratification. That is likely to take up to a year. "Thank you for your support! Now the process of ratification by each of the allies begins," Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde said on Twitter. "Look forward to working together in ensuring our collective security," she said. Just took part in historic NAC meeting where 🇸🇪 and 🇫🇮 accession protocols were signed by all NATO allies. Thank you for your support! Now the process of ratification by each of the Allies begins. Look forward to working together in ensuring our collective security. #WeAreNATO pic.twitter.com/9VNyBwk0Es  4:45 a.m.: Switzerland is hosting a conference for the second day focusing on Ukraine recovery in Lugano.

"This is a good day for Finland and Sweden, and a good day for NATO.

He added that "NATO’s door remains open to European democracies who are ready to and willing to contribute to our shared security."

Both countries submitted their applications in May, breaking longstanding non-aligned stances in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Once the accession protocols are signed, each of NATO’s 30 member countries will have to ratify them according to their individual national procedures. Both Finland and Sweden have a history of working with NATO as partner countries, including attending NATO meetings and participating in military exercises. 3:30 a.m.: 90% of Ukraine’s wind energy generators and 30% of solar energy generation were destroyed by russian invasion of #Ukraine - Energy Ministry.#RussianWarCrimes pic.twitter.com/iVIDGIFo0T  3 a.m.: Russian gas producer Gazprom said its supply of gas to Europe through Ukraine through the Sudzha entry point was seen at 42.15 million cubic meters on Tuesday compared with 42.10 mcm on Monday, according to Reuters. An application to supply gas via the Sokhranovka entry point had again been rejected by Ukraine, Reuters reported citing Gazprom. 2:25 a.m.: Belarus said on Tuesday it was freezing foreign shareholdings in 190 Belarusian companies, including EPAM Systems and Lukoil Belarus, in response to Western sanctions for its support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and human rights violations, Reuters reported. A decree published on the official legislative portal said shareholders from countries that "commit unfriendly actions against Belarusian legal entities and/or individuals are prohibited from disposing of their shares." 2 a.m.: Britain’s defense ministry said Tuesday it expects Russia to use the same tactics it employed to seize virtually all of eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk province as it pushes to control Donetsk province and reach its stated goal of holding the entire Donbas region. "The battle for the Donbas has been characterized by slow rates of advance and Russia’s massed employment of artillery, levelling towns and cities in the process," the ministry said in a statement. "The fighting in Donetsk Oblast will almost certainly continue in this manner." Russian President Vladimir Putin declared victory Monday in Luhansk province as Ukrainian troops retreated from their last stronghold in the city of Lysychansk. Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 5 July 2022 Find out more about the UK government's response: https://t.co/NVYkvuvi87🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/9YeKlckkjI  1 a.m.: Russian forces set their sights on their next objectives in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk province, after President Vladimir Putin claimed victory in neighboring Luhansk province as the five-month long war entered a new phase, Reuters reported. The capture of the city of Lysychansk on Sunday completed the Russian conquest of Luhansk, one of two regions in Donbas, the industrialized eastern region of Ukraine that has become the site of the biggest battle in Europe in generations. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties in the fight for Luhansk, particularly during the siege of the twin cities of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. Both cities have been left in ruins by the relentless Russian bombardment. Ukrainian forces on Tuesday took up new defensive lines in Donetsk, where they still control major cities, while Putin told his troops to "absolutely rest and recover their military preparedness," while units in other areas keep fighting. Since the outset of the conflict, Russia has demanded that Ukraine hand both Luhansk and Donetsk to pro-Moscow separatists, which have declared independent statelets. #Putin celebrated the #Russian seizure of #Lysychansk and the #Luhansk Oblast border and appeared to direct the Russian military to conduct an operational pause.Read the full report from @TheStudyofWar and @criticalthreats: https://t.co/YBDpvpJt9m pic.twitter.com/xTHrsdJ1Nc  12:30 a.m.: Phan Thị Kim Phuc, the girl in the famous 1972 Vietnam napalm attack photo, on Monday escorted 240 refugees from the war in Ukraine on a flight from Warsaw to Canada, The Associated Press reported. The iconic AP photo in which Kim runs with her napalm-scalded body exposed, was etched on the private NGO plane that flew the refugees to the city of Regina, the capital of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Kim, 59, a Canadian citizen, said she wants her story and work for refugees to be a message of peace. The 236 refugees, mostly women and children from across Ukraine, are among thousands of Ukrainians that Canada has provided humanitarian visas in the wake of Russia’s invasion of their country. 12:15 a.m.: U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to "do all you can" to bring home her and other Americans detained in Russia. Griner’s representatives shared parts of the letter Monday. "As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I’m terrified I might be here forever," Griner wrote. Griner was arrested in February on charges of possessing cannabis oil. Her trial began last week and is set to resume Thursday. U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said Monday that Griner is being wrongfully detained and that the Biden administration "continues to work aggressively — using every available means — to bring her home." 12:01 a.m.: Images of traditional embroideries and floral paintings adorned the walls of Dior's celebrity-laden runway homage to Ukraine as Paris’ four-day Couture Week kicked off Monday, The Associated Press reported. The set, from Ukrainian artist Olesia Trofymenko, was the starting point for designer Maria Grazia Chiuri. Dior said the embroidery-rich collection riffed on Eastern European styles that was also a message of cultural dialogue and support. Chiuri channeled the "tree of life," the leitmotif in Trofymenko’s art, by evoking roots and branches in long, loose folksy gowns, or in stiff, cropped ethnic-looking jackets embroidered in silks and cotton threads and yarn. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.
