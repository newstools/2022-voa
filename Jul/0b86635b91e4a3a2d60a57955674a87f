New Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in Thursday, taking the office of ousted leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe took the oath of office a day after members of Parliament elected him to the post. The 73-year-old, six-time prime minister had served as interim president after Rajapaksa fled the country and resigned earlier this month. Rajapaksa’s resignation came after months of protests calling for the country’s top leaders to step down amid an economic crisis. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.
