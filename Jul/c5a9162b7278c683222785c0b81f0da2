All times EDT. 12:02 a.m.: Bulgaria's defense capabilities will not be seriously affected by Moscow's decision to suspend Russian helicopter repair certificates to local companies, Defense Minister Dragomir Zakov said Friday. Zakov said Bulgaria would also continue to repair Ukrainian military equipment at its military factories, although it refused to send weapons directly. Zakov said that Moscow's decision would not seriously affect Bulgaria, nor would it hinder its repair of Ukrainian military equipment. "What happened with gas has now happened with helicopter licenses," Zakov said, referring to an earlier suspension of Russian gas deliveries to Bulgaria after it refused to pay in rubles.
