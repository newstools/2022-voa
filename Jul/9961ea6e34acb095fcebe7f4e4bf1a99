U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to "do all you can" to bring home her and other Americans detained in Russia. Griner’s representatives shared parts of the letter Monday. "As I sit here in a Russian prison, alone with my thoughts and without the protection of my wife, family, friends, Olympic jersey, or any accomplishments, I’m terrified I might be here forever," Griner wrote. Griner was arrested in February on charges of possessing cannabis oil. Her trial began last week and is set to resume Thursday. U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said Monday that Griner is being wrongfully detained and that the Biden administration "continues to work aggressively — using every available means — to bring her home." Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.
