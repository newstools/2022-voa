Norway won more gold Saturday in the mixed relay biathalon event. France won the silver, and the Russian Olympic Committee won the bronze. Athletes from Russia compete under the Olympic flag, rather than representing their country because of a penalty imposed by the World Anti-Doping Agency for Russia’s state-sponsored doping program. Dutch skater Irene Schouten broke a 20-year Olympic record in the women’s 3,000-meter speedskating event with a winning time of 3 minutes, 56.93 seconds. Italy’s Francesca Lollabrigida won the silver, while Canadian Isabelle Weidemann won the bronze. Some information in this report came from Associated Press.
