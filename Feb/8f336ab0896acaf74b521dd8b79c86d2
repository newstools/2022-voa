Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed Monday for the European Union to immediately admit Ukraine to the bloc, as the country battled a Russian invasion. Zelenskyy posted photographs of himself on social media signing an application to join the 27-member nation EU. In a video, he said, “We appeal to the European Union for the urgent accession of Ukraine via a new special procedure.” “We are grateful to our partners for being with us,” Zelenskyy said. “But our goal is to be together with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be on equal footing. I’m sure it’s fair. I’m sure we earned it. I’m sure it’s possible.” It usually takes years for any country to officially join the EU, part of a multi-step process that often requires nations to make reforms to reach EU standards. The head of Zelenskyy's office, Andrii Sybiha, said on his official Facebook page that the documents requesting EU admission "are on the way to Brussels." The EU has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has offered military assistance to Kyiv as well as imposed tough economic sanctions on Russia and blocked Russian planes from EU skies. Ukraine’s request comes after European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told Euronews in an interview Sunday of Ukraine: "They are one of us, and we want them in." However, Von der Leyen's spokesperson, Eric Mamer, clarified Monday that the EU chief did not mean that Ukraine could join immediately. He said Von der Leyen “specified that there is a process (for joining the EU). And I think that this is the important point." The application for Ukraine to join the EU, even if largely symbolic, is likely to anger Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long accused the West of trying to bring Ukraine under its influence.
