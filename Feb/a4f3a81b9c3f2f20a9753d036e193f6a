Waiting for delegations to arrive pic.twitter.com/WSnPMyChwg 12:56 a.m.: VOA’s Jamie Dettmer reports from the ground in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence expects Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to order his army in the next few hours or days to participate fully with Russia in its invasion of Ukraine. Up to now, Belarus has been used as a staging ground for Russian forces and only a few Belarusian special forces are believed to have been involved in the fighting.

The full participation of Belarus risks another front opening in the war with fears that Belarusian forces won’t just reinforce the Russian siege of Kyiv but also strike more widely across Ukraine’s northwest, endangering Lviv.

According to messages sent to NGOs and projects funded by the United States, “Cities in the West are no longer regarded as safe.” Those still inside Ukraine have been advised to seek shelter in border villages that may be safer from missiles, which will target cities and big towns.
