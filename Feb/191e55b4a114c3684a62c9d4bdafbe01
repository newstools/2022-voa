U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, was quickly removed from an event Tuesday afternoon because of a reported bomb threat. 

Emhoff was attending a Black History Month event at Dunbar High School in Washington when the Secret Service whisked him away. 

A Secret Service agent reportedly approached Emhoff and said, "We have to go." 

"We had a threat today to the facility, so we did — basically we took the precaution of evacuating everybody, as you saw. I think everyone is safe. The building is clear. But I don't have any specific details at this moment," said Enrique Gutierrez, a spokesperson for the public school system in the nation's capital. 

Emhoff was taken to a waiting motorcade. 

Students and faculty were also told to leave the building and went home for the day as police searched the building for a bomb.
