U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Sunday and accepted his invitation to visit Israel in the coming months. The White House said the two leaders discussed “shared regional and global security challenges, including the threat posed by Iran and its proxies.” A statement said Biden “took note of ongoing efforts between Israeli and Palestinian officials to lower tensions and ensure a peaceful conclusion to the holy season of Ramadan.” As past U.S. leaders have done, Biden “affirmed his unwavering support for Israel and its defense needs,” the White House said, including a $1 billion allocation to replenish Israel’s anti-missile Iron Dome air defense system.
