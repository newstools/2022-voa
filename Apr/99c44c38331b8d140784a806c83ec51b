Police in the U.S. state of Michigan released videos Wednesday showing a police officer shooting a Black man dead after a traffic stop earlier this month. Protesters gathered late Wednesday in the city of Grand Rapids to demand justice for Patrick Lyoya, a 26-year-old immigrant from the Democratic Republic of Congo, saying the shooting is the latest example of police violence against Black people in the United States. The officer has not been publicly named and was placed on paid leave while authorities investigate the shooting. Grand Rapids Police Chief Eric Winstrom, citing the need for transparency, released the videos, which include those recorded by a passenger in Lyoya’s car, the officer’s body-worn camera, the officer’s patrol car and a doorbell camera. The April 4 incident began with the officer stopping Lyoya due to a license plate not matching the car. Videos show Lyoya stepping out of the car, and later trying to walk away as the officer attempted to handcuff him. There was a short foot chase, leading to the officer and Lyoya wrestling on a lawn and fighting over the officer’s stun gun before the officer shot Lyoya. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.
