For the latest developments of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, all times EDT: 8:09 a.m.: The flow of "bloody money" to Russia must stop, Kyiv's mayor said on Tuesday as the West prepared new sanctions on Moscow after dead civilians were found lining the streets of a Ukrainian town seized from Russian invaders. "Every euro, every cent that you receive from Russia or that you send to Russia has blood, it is bloody money, and the blood of this money is Ukrainian blood, the blood of Ukrainian people," Mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko, dressed in military clothes, told a mayors' conference in Geneva via video link. Russia denies targeting civilians and said the deaths had been staged by the West to discredit it. Sanctions already imposed have isolated Russia's economy but its gas is still flowing to Europe, Reuters reported. 7:57 a.m.: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg spoke at a press briefing ahead of a NATO foreign ministers meeting on the Ukraine crisis. 🔴 LIVE SOON🎙️ Press conference previewing the meeting of #NATO Foreign Ministers #ForMin📍 @NATO HQ, Brussels https://t.co/sZnSYSmPgx 7:45 a.m.: Solomia Fedishin is drying her husband’s freshly laundered Ukrainian Army uniform. The 19-year-old is trying to cope after his death in a Russian air strike. She says she needs to be strong for the son that she will soon give birth to, and bring up as a widow. She told her story to Current Time, a co-production of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and VOA.  7:41 a.m.: Attacks against Russian and Ukrainian migrants in Germany have risen since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in remarks made available on Tuesday. Faeser told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung this week that since the end of February 308 anti-Russian offences were recorded by police, including 15 acts of violence. “Offences against Russians and Russian facilities are on the rise,” she said. Some 250,000 Russia-born migrants and 150,000 people born in Ukraine lived in Germany before President Vladmir Putin ordered Russian troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, Reuters reported. 7:36 a.m.: French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday that there is “total determination” from all 27 European Union countries for sanctions against Russia that could target oil and coal over evidence its troops deliberately killed Ukrainian civilians. Europe’s dependence on Russian oil, natural gas and coal means finding unanimity on energy measures is a tall order, but the reports of the killings outside Ukraine’s capital Kyiv have increased pressure for tougher EU sanctions, The Associated Press reported. 7: 22 a.m.: Some Ukrainians are swapping their regular jobs for journalism, many of them becoming “fixers” and assisting media companies from around the world who are in the country to cover the war. In journalism-speak, fixers are local people who work closely with foreign reporters on everything from securing interviews, translating, and booking hotels to more crucial work including advising on possible threats and no-go areas. Often these are journalists already established in their home country. But some are new to the profession — and learning on the job while navigating a war zone. VOA’s Sirwan Kajjo has the story. 7:16 a.m.: A growing number of European nations have announced they are expelling Russian diplomats, Reuters reports. Sweden will expel three Russian diplomats for spying, Foreign Minister Ann Linde said on Tuesday. "It is because they are not following the Vienna Convention and they are undertaking illegal intelligence-gathering operations," Linde told reporters. France, Belgium and the Netherlands have recently expelled Russian diplomats over alleged spying activity. Spain will expel some 25 Russian diplomats and embassy staff from Madrid, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said on Tuesday, in response to alleged war crimes by the Russian military in Ukraine. Denmark and Italy also announced Tuesday they were expelling Russian diplomats. Russia will give an appropriate response, TASS news agency quoted Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying. 6:50 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says there is "no other choice" than to negotiate an end to the war with Russia, even if it's difficult to do amid signs that Russian forces may have committed atrocities against civilians. Speaking in an interview with Ukrainian journalists that was broadcast on state television Tuesday, Zelenskyy called the events in Bucha "unforgiveable," and that "all of us, including myself, will perceive even the possibility of negotiations as a challenge." The interview comes a day after Zelenskyy made an emotional trip to Bucha outside the capital, where Ukrainian officials say the bodies of civilians have been found, many of them shot in yards, streets, and homes. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has this report. 6:31 a.m.: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell will travel to Kyiv this week for a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, an EU spokesman said on Tuesday. The meeting will take place "prior to the pledging event #StandUpForUkraine on Saturday in Warsaw," EU spokesman Eric Mamer wrote on Twitter. Von der Leyen on Monday tweeted that she spoke with Zelenskyy “about the murder of civilians in Bucha and elsewhere” and that “the EU is ready to send Joint Investigation Teams to document war crimes in coordination with the Ukrainian Prosecutor General." 6:20 a.m.: Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Tuesday met with Poland’s Minister of Climate and Environment to coordinate their cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is providing advice and assistance to maintain safety and security at Ukrainian nuclear facilities, and to discuss Ukrainian-Polish energy projects.

We also discussed big and mutually beneficial Ukrainian-Polish energy projects. pic.twitter.com/Gbjfbadlph 6:15 a.m.: Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer plans to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy in Ukraine in the coming days to discuss humanitarian and political support for the country, his office said in a statement on Tuesday according to Reuters. “For security reasons no further details of this trip can be announced for the time being,” the statement said, adding that the two men had had a phone conversation on Monday evening. 5:30 a.m.: Italy has expelled 30 Russian diplomats because of security concerns, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Tuesday, and Russia was set to retaliate, according to TASS, Reuters reported. A number of other Western governments have taken similar steps following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Italy summoned Russia’s ambassador to the foreign ministry on Tuesday to tell him that the diplomats were being expelled. “The measure is in agreement with other European and Atlantic partners and is necessary for reasons linked to our national security and in the context of the current crisis caused by the unjustified aggression against Ukraine on the part of the Russian Federation,” Di Maio said in a statement. Russia will give an appropriate response, TASS news agency quoted Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying. 5:00 a.m.: Denmark’s Foreign Ministry says the country is expelling 15 Russian intelligence officers who worked at Russia’s Embassy in Copenhagen. The ministry said the Russian ambassador was informed of the decision on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. It said Denmark strongly condemned “Russia’s brutality against Ukrainian civilians in Bucha” and stressed that “deliberate attacks on civilians are a war crime.” The officers have two weeks to leave Denmark. Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said, “they pose a risk to our national security that we cannot ignore.” 4:30 a.m.: Reuters reported that the United States Treasury blocked Russia from using reserves it holds at American banks to make more than $600 million in sovereign debt payments, raising the prospect of a Russian debt default. Reuters has the story. 3:30 a.m.: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiyy said on Tuesday holding negotiations with Russia was the only option for his country although the possibility of having talks was now a “challenge.” But in comments broadcast on national television, he said it was possible that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin would not personally hold talks, Reuters reported. 3:00 a.m.: A top official in the global campaign against the use of land mines is urging Russia to halt the use in Ukraine of these weapons that too often kill and maim civilians, The Associated Press reported. Alicia Arango Olmos, Colombia’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva and this year’s president of the state parties to the 1997 convention banning the production and use of land mines, expressed deep concern at media reports that Russia is using land mines in its war in Ukraine. She pointed to Human Rights Watch which said on March 29 that Ukrainian explosive ordnance disposal technician located banned ant-personnel mines in the eastern Kharkiv region a day earlier. The rights group said Russia is known to possess the type of mines that were discovered, but Ukraine doesn’t have them. Arango Olmos told a news conference Monday that Ukraine is one of the 164 state parties to the convention, but Russia is not. Monday was the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action. 2:30 a.m.: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine becomes deadlier by the day, with world leaders accusing Russia of war crimes as video out of the Kyiv suburb of Bucha shows people shot and left dead in the streets. VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb has more. Warning: This video contains graphic images and may not be suitable for all viewers.  No media source currently available 2:00 a.m.: Ukrainian forces have retaken key northern terrain, forcing Russian forces to retreat from areas around the city of Chernihiv and north of the capital Kyiv, British military intelligence said on Tuesday. Low-level fighting is likely to continue in some of the recaptured areas, but reduce this week as the remainder of the Russian forces withdraw, the defense ministry said in a regular bulletin on Twitter. Many of the withdrawing Russian units are likely to require significant re-equipping and refurbishment before they redeploy for operations in the country's east, the ministry added. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

Tuesday’s session includes briefings from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths, as well as an address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Britain holds the rotating presidency of the council this month, and its U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward told reporters the issue of civilian killings during the Russian invasion of Ukraine would be “front and center.” 1:15 a.m.: The Japanese government flew 20 Ukrainian refugees into Tokyo on Tuesday in a high-profile show of support for the international effort to help Ukraine by a country that has long been reluctant to take in foreigners. The 20 - aged from 6 and 66 and including 15 women — are not the first Ukrainian refugees to arrive in Japan since Russia invaded their homeland on February 24 — but they are the first to be flown in on a special government plane on a trip arranged by Japan’s foreign minister, Reuters reported. “The government of Japan is committed to provide the maximum support to these 20 Ukrainians to help them live with a sense of peace in Japan, even though they are far away from their home county,” Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters in Poland shortly before he and the refugees set off for Japan.
