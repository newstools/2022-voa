U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas were set to travel to Panama Tuesday for a two-day summit to discuss migration and other bilateral issues. Panama has become a transit point for migrants seeking to come to the United States, with record numbers entering the country, Reuters reported. The U.S. saw a record number of migrants trying to cross the southern border in the first year of President Joe Biden's administration. An even higher number is expected this year. Early in the administration, Biden promised to address the root causes of migration and promised $1.2 billion in assistance to Central American countries. "The United States is the largest humanitarian donor to international organizations in Panama, whose work complements the Government of Panama's efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to vulnerable migrants and refugees," Blinken said in a statement.
