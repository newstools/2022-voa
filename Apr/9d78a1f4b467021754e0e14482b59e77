Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned what he called “the massacre of Bucha,” days after the discovery of bodies in the streets of the Ukrainian city and in mass graves sparked international outrage. Speaking during his weekly audience at the Vatican, the pope said the latest news from Ukraine “brought new atrocities” instead of relief and hope. "Stop this war! Let the weapons fall silent! Stop sowing death and destruction," he said. The pope held up a flag he said came from Bucha and kissed it. Russia has denied its forces committed any war crimes, accusing Ukraine of fabricating the scenes. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.
