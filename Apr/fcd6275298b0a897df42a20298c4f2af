Russia's invasion of Ukraine has internally displaced 7.1 million people in the country, a new report says. The report by the Organization for Migration (IOM), which covers data from March 24 to April 1, found that the number of internally displaced people increased 10% since the first round of the survey two weeks prior. "People continue to flee their homes because of war, and the humanitarian needs on the ground continue to soar," said IOM Director General António Vitorino in a press release. "Humanitarian corridors are urgently needed to allow the safe evacuation of civilians and ensure the safe transportation and delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid in order to rapidly assist those internally displaced." The report found that more than 50% of displaced households have children, 57% have elderly members and 30% have people with chronic illnesses. Displaced families have seen sharp drops in income, with one-third saying they had not gotten any income in the past month, the report said. Many of the displaced people need food, shelter, hygiene items, medicine and health services, the report said.
