Vice President Kamala Harris has tested positive for COVID-19, though she is experiencing no symptoms, her office announced Tuesday. In a statement, the vice president’s Press Secretary Kirsten Allen said Harris tested positive for COVID-19 on rapid and PCR tests. The statement said she will isolate and continue to work from her residence. Allen said the vice president has not been a close contact to U.S. President Joe Biden or First Lady Jill Biden, due to their respective recent travel schedules. “She will follow CDC guidelines and the advice of her physicians. The Vice President will return to the White House when she tests negative,” the statement said. The 57-year-old vice president has been vaccinated and received two booster shots, the latest shot on April 1. Some information for this report was provided by the Associated Press and Reuters.
