Airline passengers and users of mass transit in the U.S. will be required to wear masks for at least 15 days beyond April 18, when current mask requirements were set to expire. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday announced the extension to May 3, saying it was needed to assess a recent uptick in cases caused by the BA.2 omicron subvariant. Current mandates in transportation have been in effect since February 2021. "In order to assess the potential impact the rise of cases has on severe disease, including hospitalizations and deaths and health care system capacity, the CDC order will remain in place at this time," the agency said in a statement. Many jurisdictions have been rolling back mask mandates as overall COVID-19 cases have dropped around the country. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.
