The United States said Monday it wants the U.N. General Assembly to remove Russia from the U.N. Human Rights Council, citing allegations of war crimes committed in Ukraine. "Russia's participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,” said Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. "And it is wrong, which is why we believe it is time the U.N. General Assembly vote to remove them." Thomas-Greenfield based her call for Russia’s removal on allegations by Ukraine that Russian troops killed dozens of civilians in the town of Bucha. Ukraine said it is investigating the killings, and Russia has denied any involvement. A two-thirds vote by the 193-member assembly is required to remove Russia from the council. The council, which is based in Geneva, is largely symbolic, but it can authorize investigations into human rights violations. Russia is in its second year of a three-year stint on the 47-member council. It has yet to comment on calls for its removal. Since Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine, the General Assembly has passed two resolutions condemning the country’s actions. Some information in this report comes from Reuters.
