Russia has accused the West trying to derail peace talks with Ukraine by fueling "hysteria" over allegations of war crimes by Moscow's forces following their retreat from the Kyiv region. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that Moscow believed the war crime accusations were timed to derail the negotiating process.

Kyiv and the West say there is evidence, including images and witness testimony gathered by Reuters and other media organizations, that Russia committed war crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. Moscow denies the charge and has called the allegations a "monstrous forgery."
