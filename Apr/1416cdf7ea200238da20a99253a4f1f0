At least 35 people were killed Thursday when a bus carrying Easter worshippers crashed into a ravine in eastern Zimbabwe about 10 p.m. local time. The bus reportedly was carrying 106 passengers of the Zion Christian Church to an Easter pilgrimage. Seventy-one people were reported injured in the crash. 

"The bodies of the victims were taken to Chipinge Hospital for post-mortem while the injured were referred to the same institution for treatment, with 13 being critically injured," said the Zimbabwe Republic Police, CNN reported. 

Between 2017 and 2019, the country averaged upward of 2,000 traffic deaths per year, but that number could be much higher, CNN said. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.
