The latest developments of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. All times EDT: 1:15 am According to The New York Times, Ukrainians who fled their homeland with their dogs are discovering at the U.S. border that, in most cases, their four legged family members not allowed into the U.S. because of the high incidence of rabies in Ukraine. 12:30 a.m.: Russia on Thursday warned the U.S. that the weapons supplied to Ukraine by the U.S. and other NATO countries were "adding fuel" to the conflict and could bring about “unpredictable consequences” the Washington Post reported. The Post said the U.S. State Department declined to comment on the diplomatic communication, or any U.S. response. George Beebe, a former director of Russia analysis at the CIA, told the newspaper that if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to experience setbacks, Russia may attack NATO supply convoys delivering weapons in Ukraine, or even hit targets in NATO countries near Ukraine. "There has been an assumption on the part of a lot of us in the West that we could supply the Ukrainians really without limits and not bear significant risk of retaliation from Russia," he said. "I think the Russians want to send a message here that that’s not true." 12:20 a.m.: Two U.S. lawmakers traveled to Kyiv, Ukraine Thursday, becoming the first U.S. officials to visit since Russia invaded the country February 24. Rep.Victoria Spartz of Indiana and Sen. Steve Daines of Montana – both Republicans – also visited the town of Bucha outside of Kyiv, where the bodies of civilians were found in the streets and mass graves after Russian troops left. Spartz is the first Ukranian-born person to serve in the U.S. Congress.
