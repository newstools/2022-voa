Chinese President Xi Jinping Thursday reiterated his government’s position that international disputes should be resolved through dialogue and not sanctions, a tacit reference to the West’s punitive actions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at a forum in Hainan, Xi said China is “committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries” and not interfering in their internal affairs. "We should uphold the principle of indivisibility of security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the building of national security on the basis of insecurity in other countries,” Xi said. Chin China has maintained close ties to Russia, not condemning its invasion of Ukraine while also criticizing the sanctions imposed against Russia in recent months.
