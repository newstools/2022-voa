All times EDT: 6:10 a.m.: German gas lobby group Zukunft Gas (Future Gas) said on Wednesday Germany must immediately start stockpiling more gas now that Russia is using the energy source as a political tool, Reuters reported. “We need to save gas now so that we have enough in winter,” said the group’s head Timm Kehler in a statement. 5:25 a.m.: Russia’s defense ministry said Wednesday its forces carried out missile strikes overnight that destroyed 59 targets in Ukraine, including “hangars with a large batch of foreign weapons and ammunition” sent by the United States and European countries to aid Ukraine’s military. The United States and its allies signaled Tuesday they are moving swiftly and powerfully to support Ukrainian forces and escalate pressure on Russia’s economy. The United States at first “needed weeks” to move military equipment and munitions to Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but it now often dispatches new armaments to the Ukrainians within three days. 4:55 a.m.: Jan Lipavsky, the Czech Republic’s foreign minister, spoke to VOA during a visit to Washington this week. The conversation focused on his country’s support for Ukraine including its European Union membership aspirations, post-war reconstruction, the Czech Republic’s upcoming EU rotating presidency beginning July 1. VOA’s Natalie Liu has the report.  4:00 a.m.: Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said Wednesday that Russia’s warning to shut off gas supplies to his country over payment to Gazprom “was not acceptable” and characterized the warning as “one-sided blackmail.” Petkov said Bulgaria is reviewing the contracts with the energy giant including contracts for transit of Russian gas to Serbia and Hungary. Petkov said he has talked to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had assured him the 27-member bloc would have a common response, Reuters reported. A number of European Union members have moved to lessen or eliminate their dependence on Russian energy, including by seeking other sources and boosting their use of renewable energy. “Gazprom’s announcement is another attempt by Russia to blackmail us with gas,” EU Commission President von der Leyen said Wednesday. “We are prepared for this scenario. We are mapping out our coordinated EU response.” 3:15 a.m.: Russian energy giant Gazprom GAZP.MM said on Wednesday it has completely halted gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland due to absence of payments from the countries in roubles for the fuel delivery, Reuters reported. It said the supplies will be halted until the payments are made. 2:40 a.m.: Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak on Wednesday welcomed promises by the United States and its allies to send more heavy weaponry to Ukraine following talks at a German air base. “One of Russia’s odd demands at the start of the war was the ‘full demilitarization’ of Ukraine. After yesterday’s epochal meeting of 40 defense ministers, I have bad news for Russia. Capacity, speed, simplified logistics, an expanded range of weapons — Ukraine is strengthening,” he wrote on Twitter. 2:10 a.m.: Reuters reported that Russian gas nominations via Ukraine to Europe stand at 49.8 million cubic meters (mcm) for Wednesday, down from 56 mcm on Tuesday, data from Ukraine’s gas pipeline operator showed. 1:35 a.m.: NATO and allied nations have agreed to step up their military support for Ukraine to fight the Russian invasion, following a meeting hosted by the U.S. Secretary of Defense who warned that weapons must be delivered quickly as the war enters a crucial phase. For VOA, Henry Ridgwell reports. No media source currently available 1:10 a.m.: The U.K. military intelligence said Wednesday that Russia has limited air access to the north and west of Ukraine, limiting offensive actions to deep strikes with stand-off weapons. “Russian air activity is primarily focused on southern and eastern Ukraine, providing support to Russian ground forces,” the daily battleground report said in a statement posted on Twitter.
