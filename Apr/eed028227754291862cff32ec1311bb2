Authorities in the Philippines say at least 138 people are dead in the wake of Cyclone Megi, which made landfall Sunday, causing heavy rains, flooding and landslides. More than 162,000 people have been displaced, Philippine officials say, and that scores more are still missing. Many of those killed were buried in landslides, according to news reports. Others reportedly drowned. One district, Kantagnos, has been “greatly devastated,” according to a Facebook post by an army battalion in Leyte province. "Homes and livelihoods have been damaged, families and individuals are missing and communication have been unstable," said the post. The army says search and rescue operations will continue.
Megi was the first cyclone of 2022 in a country that usually sees around 20 storms a year. Some information in this report comes from Reuters, the Associated Press and AFP.
