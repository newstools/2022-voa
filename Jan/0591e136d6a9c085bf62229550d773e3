A gunman at a German university on Monday killed one and wounded three during a lecture in the school's auditorium before fatally shooting himself. The incident took place at the University of Heidelberg in southwestern Germany, and police say the man appears to have acted alone. "We assume that there was only one perpetrator. At this stage we see no further danger to the public," police said. The suspect, who was reportedly a student, reportedly used a rifle and also had other firearms. No motive has been determined. "My sympathy in this terrible situation. So terrible. I am shocked," tweeted lawmaker Franziska Brantner, who is from the area. Heidelberg has about 160,000 inhabitants and is located to the south of Frankfurt. The university is Germany’s oldest and best known. Some information in this report comes from The Associated Press.
