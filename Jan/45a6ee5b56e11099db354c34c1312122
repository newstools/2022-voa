Officials in Taiwan say a powerful earthquake struck Taiwan late Monday, shaking buildings in the capital, Taipei, and across much of the northern part of the island, but there were no reports of serious damage. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake measured a magnitude 6.2 and was centered at a depth of 28.7 kilometers below the ocean east of Hualien city on the island's east coast. A spokesperson from Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau put the quake's magnitude at 6.0 at a depth of 19.6 kilometers. The strongest impact was recorded in Taipei and in parts of Yilan, measuring 4 on Taiwan's 7-level intensity scale. A local television station aired video taken during the quake in its newsroom in New Taipei showing televisions and lamps shaking. Other video reports showed damage to a wall in Taipei's District Court. The USGS said economic losses were expected to be low despite the strong earthquake.
