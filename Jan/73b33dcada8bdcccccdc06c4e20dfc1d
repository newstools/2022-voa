Terrorist group al-Shabab has claimed responsibility for a suicide car bombing Wednesday near the Somali capital's international airport that killed at least nine people and wounded 15 more. A spokesman for Somalia’s police force Abdifatah Hassan Ali confirmed the casualties were caused by a suicide bomber who detonated a car. Mogadishu’s Deputy Mayor Ali Yare Ali said he survived the Wednesday attack, without giving more details. Somali media report terrorist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, which the Islamist group said targeted a convoy carrying foreigners. The claim could not be independently verified. The deadly blast comes just days after Somali leaders agreed to hold in February long-delayed elections that widened a rift between the president and prime minister. Analysts have been warning that al-Shabab would take advantage of the political tensions, and any perceived power vacuum, to launch attacks. The U.S. Embassy in Somalia condemned the terrorist attack. The United States strongly condemns today’s terrorist attack in Mogadishu. Our thoughts are with the victims and with the families of those tragically killed and injured.
