U.S. first lady Jill Biden is traveling Thursday to the state of Kentucky to survey damage from deadly storms that hit last month and to speak with officials about recovery efforts. Joining Biden on the trip to the city of Bowling Green is Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Erik Hooks. Severe storms in December brought tornadoes, other damaging winds and flooding to parts Kentucky, leaving 77 people dead and widespread damage. Another round of tornadoes Jan. 1 hit some of the same areas. Biden is due to meet with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and his wife, Britainy. The White House said Biden would highlight cooperation between federal and local agencies. President Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for Kentucky last month to speed federal aid. Beshear announced in an address late Wednesday proposed legislation that would send $150 million to communities hit by the storms, as well as $50 million to fund recovery efforts for schools. “We will rebuild,” Beshear said. “Every structure and every life.”
