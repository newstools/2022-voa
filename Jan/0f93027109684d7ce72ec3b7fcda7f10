Police in western Germany report two officers were shot and killed Monday during a pre-dawn traffic stop. Rhineland-Palatinate district police spokesman Bernhard Christian Erfort said the two officers reported via radio they were carrying out a traffic stop at 4:20 a.m. local time between Ulmet and Mayweilerhof in the west central Kusel district. A short time later, they reported in again, saying that shots were being fired, and the radio connection was lost. The spokesman said officers were dispatched to the scene where they found the officers – a 24-year-old female and 29-year-old male – had been shot. One of the officers was still alive when the second team arrived but died shortly thereafter at the scene. The police spokesman said they believe more than one suspect was involved in the shooting but could not say how many. He said police had no description of the suspects or their car. He did say police from several nearby districts were involved in the manhunt for the perpetrators and warned at least one of the suspects is armed. Police urged drivers not to pick up hitchhikers.
