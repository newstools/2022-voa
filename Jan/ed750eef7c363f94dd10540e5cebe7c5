French oil giant TotalEnergies on Friday said it would withdraw from Myanmar over "worsening" human rights abuses committed since the country's military took power in a February 2021 coup. "The situation, in terms of human rights and more generally the rule of law, which have kept worsening in Myanmar... has led us to reassess the situation and no longer allows TotalEnergies to make a sufficiently positive contribution in the country," the company said. Total will withdraw from its Yadana gas field in the Andaman Sea, which provides electricity to the local Burmese and Thai population, six months at the latest after the expiry of its contractual period. The company said it had not identified any means to sanction the military junta without avoiding stopping gas production and ensuing payments to the military-controlled Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE). Around 30% of the gas produced at Yadana is sold to the MOGE for domestic use, providing about half of the largest city Yangon's electricity supply, according to Total. International diplomatic pressure and sanctions have been building against Myanmar's military junta since last year's coup ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The European Union has imposed targeted sanctions on the Myanmar military, its leaders and entities, while Norwegian telecoms operator Telenor this week sold its stake in a Burmese digital payments service over the coup. More than 1,400 civilians have been killed as the military cracks down on dissent, according to a local monitoring group, and numerous anti-junta militias have sprung up around the country. Suu Kyi this month was convicted of three criminal charges and sentenced to four years in prison and now faces five new corruption charges.
